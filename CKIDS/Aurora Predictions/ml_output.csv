0,1,"1, 3, 5, 10",Introduction While it is recognized that there are costs associated with postoperative patient follow-up risk assessments of catastrophic health expenditures CHEs due to surgery in sub-Saharan Africa rarely include expenses after discharge We describe patient-level costs for cesarean section c-section and follow-up care up to postoperative day POD 30 and evaluate the contribution of follow-up to CHEs in rural Rwanda Methods We interviewed women who delivered via c-section at Kirehe District Hospital between September 2019 and February 2020 Expenditure details were captured on an adapted surgical indicator financial survey tool and extracted from the hospital billing system CHE was defined as health expenditure of  10 of annual household expenditure We report the cost of c-section up to 30 days after discharge the rate of CHE among c-section patients stratified by in-hospital costs and post-discharge follow-up costs and the main contributors to c-section follow-up costs We performed a multivariate logistic regression using a backward stepwise process to determine independent predictors of CHE at POD30 at α  005 Results Of the 479 participants in this study 90 were classified as impoverished before surgery and an additional 64 were impoverished by the c-section The median out-of-pocket costs up to POD30 was US12216 IQR 10294 14811 63 of these expenditures were attributed to post-discharge expenses or lost opportunity costs US7750 IQR 6770 9560 To afford c-section care 644 borrowed money and 184 sold possessions The CHE rate was 27 when only considering direct and indirect costs up to the time of discharge and 77 when including the reported expenses up to POD30 Transportation and lost household wages were the largest contributors to post-discharge costs Further CHE at POD30 was independently predicted by membership in community-based health insurance aOR  340 95 CI 121960 being a farmer aOR  225 95 CI100303 primary school education aOR  235 95 CI191466 and small household sizes had 022 lower odds of experiencing CHE compared to large households aOR  078 95 CI066091 Conclusion Costs associated with surgical follow-up are often neglected in financial risk calculations but contribute significantly to the risk of CHE in rural Rwanda Insurance coverage for direct medical costs is insufficient to protect against CHE Innovative follow-up solutions to reduce costs of patient transport and compensate for household lost wages need to be considered,10.1186/s12939-022-01664-x,"['1', '5', '10']","[0.45260605, 0.1461877, 0.26832375]","{'1': 0.45260605, '5': 0.1461877, '10': 0.26832375}",1
1,1,"1, 3, 16",OBJECTIVES To determine the role of raceethnicity and poverty in the likelihood of children younger than age 3 years hospitalized because of child abuse and neglect-related injuries being reported to child protective services CPS and being assigned a specific maltreatment diagnostic code METHODS We used population-based linked administrative data comprising of birth hospitalization and CPS records Children were identified for maltreatment-related hospitalizations using standardized diagnostic codes Regression models were used to compute crude and adjusted raceethnicity estimates regarding the likelihood of being reported to CPS and assigned a specific maltreatment diagnostic code during the maltreatment-related hospitalization RESULTS Of the 3907 children hospitalized because of child maltreatment those with public health insurance were more likely than those with private insurance relative risk RR 129 95 confidence interval CI 116-142 and those with AsianPacific Islander mothers were less likely than those with White mothers to be reported to CPS RR 078 95 CI 065-093 No differences were found for children with Black Hispanic and Native American mothers compared with those with White mothers for CPS reporting However children with Native American mothers RR 145 95 CI 111-190 and public health insurance RR 200 95 CI 163-245 were more likely to have a specific maltreatment diagnostic code the second strongest predictor of a CPS report CONCLUSIONS Raceethnicity and poverty were factors for CPS reports during a child maltreatment-related hospitalization It is necessary to implement programs and policies that mitigate implicit bias to prevent inequities in which children receive protective intervention,10.1542/peds.2021-053346,"['1', '10']","[0.7201732, 0.14859931]","{'1': 0.7201732, '10': 0.14859931}",1

11,2,"2, 10",With recent research identifying mobility restrictions for alleviating the spread of COVID-19 governments have implemented stay-at-home measures which in turn produced significant changes in peoples travel behaviours Despite these orders however people still have to make trips for work or to acquire essential goods To better understand how these necessary trips influenced changes in individual mobility due to the pandemic this study focused on the relationship between trip frequency and distance to median incomes as well as between trip frequency and distance to supermarket density We made use of the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform as our primary source for GPS travel data to study mobility changes at the county-level across the USA Results showed that trip frequency and distance were significantly different before the outbreak of COVID-19 and during three peak periods of COVID-19 infection Specifically we found the reduction of both frequency and distance of trips is negatively correlated to both median income and supermarket density Thus we conclude that individual choice in adherence to staying-at-home is less dependent on the lockdown measures and more influenced by financial capacity and access to necessary goods and services These findings could help inform policy development and programmatic responses to help people reduce their mobility For example government authorities might consider monthly stimulus or other financial support programs that would allow people greater access to delivery services In the future urban planners and policymakers should address the root causes that lead to such economic disparities and food insecurities in order to build resilience in the face of possible future pandemics,10.1080/12265934.2021.1952890,"['1', '2', '8', '10']","[0.4059453, 0.2393637, 0.1070219, 0.13406962]","{'1': 0.4059453, '2': 0.2393637, '8': 0.1070219, '10': 0.13406962}",1
