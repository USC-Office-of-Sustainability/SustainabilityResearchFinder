4,1,[TITLE] To Punish Parent or Palliate Governing Urban Poverty through Institutional Failure [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Studies of poverty governance typically emphasize the punitive subjugation or paternalistic disciplining of the poor Much work combines elements of these approaches and recent studies depict relations between institutions as premised on collaboration or burden shuffling Despite the precarity of poor peoples existence the role of life itself in governance is conspicuously absent in this literature Using an ethnographic case study of a syringe exchange program serving unhoused people who inject drugs in Los Angeles this article theorizes palliative governance to describe forms of regulation that neither punish nor parent but simply try to keep very poor subjects alive through a series of stopgap measures Rather than collaborate or burden shuffle exchange workers supplement contest and co-opt other governing institutions An analysis of palliative governance broadens our understanding of how institutions interact with subjects and each other while revealing the paradoxical ways states both expose and protect bare life
5,1,[TITLE] A Mixed Methods Evaluation of Interventions to Meet the Requirements of California Senate Bill 1152 in the Emergency Departments of a Public Hospital System [KEYWORDS] emergency department health policy homelessness SB 1152 social emergency medicine [ABSTRACT] Policy Points Clarifications to Senate Bill SB1152 are necessary to address the differences between inpatient and emergency department ED discharge processes determine how frequently an ED must deliver the SB1152 bundle of services to a single patient and establish expectations for compliance during off-hours when social services are unavailable Because homelessness cannot be resolved in a single ED visit the state should provide funding to support housing-focused case workers that will follow patients experiencing homelessness PEH through the transition from temporary shelters to permanent supportive housing Medi-Cal could fund the delivery of the SB1152 bundle of services to defray the costs to public hospitals that provide care for high numbers of PEH California legislators should consider complementary legislation to increase funding for shelters so that sufficient capacity is available to accept PEH from EDs and hospitals and to fund alternative strategies to prevent poverty and the upstream root causes of homelessness itself Context Prompted by stories of patient dumping California enacted Senate Bill SB 1152 which mandates that hospitals offer patients experiencing homelessness PEH a set of resources at discharge to ensure safety and prevent dumping Methods To evaluate interventions to meet the requirements of SB1152 across three emergency departments EDs of a Los Angeles County public hospital system with a combined annual census of 260000 visits we used an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach focusing first on quantitative evaluation and then using information from qualitative interviews to explain the quantitative findings Findings In total 29 151552607 of encounters involved PEH Documentation of compliance with the eight required components of SB1152 was low ranging from 90 to 339 Twenty-five provider interviews confirmed support for providing assistance to PEH in the ED but the participants described barriers to compliance including challenges in implementing universal screening for homelessness incongruity of the requirements with the ED setting the complexity of the patients and the limitations of SB1152 as a health policy Conclusions Despite operationalizing universal screening for homelessness we found poor compliance with SB1152 and identified multiple barriers to implementation
6,1,[TITLE] Learning Resource Allocation Policies from Observational Data with an Application to Homeless Services Delivery [KEYWORDS] Causal Inference Fairness in AI Mixed-integer Optimization Observational Data [ABSTRACT] We study the problem of learning from observational data fair and interpretable policies that effectively match heterogeneous individuals to scarce resources of different types We model this problem as a multi-class multi-server queuing system where both individuals and resources arrive stochastically over time Each individual upon arrival is assigned to a queue where they wait to be matched to a resource The resources are assigned in a first come first served FCFS fashion according to an eligibility structure that encodes the resource types that serve each queue We propose a methodology based on techniques in modern causal inference to construct the individual queues as well as learn the matching outcomes and provide a mixed-integer optimization MIO formulation to optimize the eligibility structure The MIO problem maximizes policy outcome subject to wait time and fairness constraints It is very flexible allowing for additional linear domain constraints We conduct extensive analyses using synthetic and real-world data In particular we evaluate our framework using data from the US Homeless Management Information System HMIS We obtain wait times as low as an FCFS policy while improving the rate of exit from homelessness for underserved or vulnerable groups 7 higher for the Black individuals and 15 higher for those below 17 years old and overall
7,1,[TITLE] Traumatic Stress and Homelessness A Review of the Literature for Practitioners [KEYWORDS] Homelessness Resiliency Trauma Trauma-informed care Traumatic stress [ABSTRACT] A growing body of evidence connects traumatic stress and homelessness which illustrates the importance of trauma and-resiliency-informed care TIC to appropriately serve persons experiencing homelessness PEH This paper reviews the literature on traumatic stress including the biology of trauma as well as psychosocial environmental and systemic factors These areas of knowledge constitute necessary elements when designing systems of care for PEH in order to provide effective services avoid re-traumatization and create healing environments to foster resilience The authors identify trauma-specific evidence-based therapies and comprehensive programmatic approaches that stem from established trauma-informed core values Practical applications of the reviewed literature are utilized to demonstrate how organizations can adopt a trauma and resiliency-informed approach based on both the reviewed literature as well as the authors collective clinical experience A key takeaway is an emerging consensus that service providers must consider trauma when designing and offering services to persons with a history of homelessness The authors offer recommendations for future pathways to create outcome measurement tools for social service providers based on the theory of self-efficacy and using concrete quantifiable variables
8,1,[TITLE] Getting to the Root of the Problem A Decision-Tree Analysis for Suicide Risk Among Young People Experiencing Homelessness [KEYWORDS] decision tree homeless machine learning suicide [ABSTRACT] Objective Although many suicide risk factors have been identified there is limited guidance about their relative importance and the combinations of factors that heighten risk among young people experiencing homelessness YEH We sought to use decision-tree DT analyses to better understand and predict suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among YEH Method Using survey and social network methods we gathered information about 940 YEH and their relationships We then used a machine learning approach to construct classification and regression tree models to predict suicidal ideation and suicide attempts Results Thirteen variables were important correlates in the DT models this included prominent individual risk factors eg trauma depression but more than half were social network factors eg hard drug use For suicidal ideation the model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC value of 079 with accuracy of 68 sensitivity of 48 and specificity of 73 For suicide attempt the model had an AUC value of 086 with accuracy of 71 sensitivity of 68 and specificity of 72 Conclusions Effective suicide prevention programming should target the syndemic that threatens YEH ie co-occurrence of trauma depression substance use and vio-lence including social norms in their environments With refinement our decision trees may be useful for suicide risk screening and guiding targeted intervention
9,1,[TITLE] The Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion A difference-in-differences study of spillover participation in SNAP [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] The Affordable Care Acts Medicaid expansion to individuals with adults under 138 percent of the federal poverty level led to insurance coverage for millions of Americans in participating states This study investigates Medicaid expansions potential spillover participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP formerly the Food Stamp Program In addition to providing public insurance the policy connects individuals to SNAP affecting social determinants of health such as hunger We use difference-in-differences regression to estimate the effect of the Medicaid expansion on SNAP participation among approximately 414000 individuals from across the United States The Current Population Survey is used to answer the main research question and the SNAP Quality Control Database allows for supplemental analyses Medicaid expansion produces a 29 percentage point increase p  0002 in SNAP participation among individuals under 138 percent of federal poverty Subgroup analyses find a larger 50 percentage point increase p  0002 in households under 75 percent of federal poverty without children Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents ABAWDs are a category of individuals with limited access to SNAP Although they are a subset of adults without children we found no spillover effect for ABAWDs We find an increase in SNAP households with 0 income supporting the finding that spillover was strongest for very-low-income individuals Joint processing of Medicaid and SNAP applications helps facilitate the connection between Medicaid expansion and SNAP Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that Medicaid expansion does more than improve access to health care by connecting eligible individuals to supports like SNAP SNAP recipients have increased access to food an important social determinant of health Our study supports reducing administrative burdens to help connect individuals to safety net programs Finally we note that ABAWDs are a vulnerable group that need targeted program outreach
10,2,[TITLE] Association between food insecurity and fall-related injury among adults aged 65 years in low- and middle-income countries The role of mental health conditions [KEYWORDS] Accidental Falls Aged Cross-Sectional Studies Developing Countries Female Food Insecurity Food Supply Humans Male Mental Health Prevalence accidental injury aged anxiety Article cognitive defect cross-sectional study depression disease association falling female food availability food insecurity high risk population human hunger low income country major clinical study male mediation analysis mental disease middle income country multivariate logistic regression analysis sleep disorder World Health Organization catering service developing country food insecurity mental health prevalence [ABSTRACT] Purpose We investigated the association between food insecurity and fall-related injury among older adults from six low- and middle-income countries LMICs and the extent to which this association is mediated by mental health Methods Cross-sectional community-based nationally representative data from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health SAGE were analyzed Past 12-month food insecurity was assessed with two questions on frequency of eating less and hunger due to lack of food Fall-related injury referred to those that occurred in the past 12 months Multivariable logistic regression analysis and mediation analysis were conducted to assess associations Results Data on 14585 adults aged 65 years mean SD age 725 115 years 549 females were analyzed After adjustment for potential confounders severe food insecurity versus no food insecurity was associated with 195 95CI  111341 times higher odds for fall-related injury Moderate food insecurity was not significantly associated with fall-related injury OR  134 95CI  081225 The mediation analysis showed that 373 218 177 and 140 of the association between severe food insecurity and fall-related injury was explained by anxiety sleep problems depression and cognition respectively Conclusion Severe food insecurity was associated with higher odds for injurious falls among older adults in LMICs and a large proportion of this association may be explained by mental health complications Interventions to improve mental health among those who are food insecure and a strong focus on societal and government efforts to reduce food insecurity may contribute to a decrease in injurious falls
11,2,[TITLE] Is travel behaviour an equity issue Using GPS location data to assess the effects of income and supermarket availability on travel reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] With recent research identifying mobility restrictions for alleviating the spread of COVID-19 governments have implemented stay-at-home measures which in turn produced significant changes in peoples travel behaviours Despite these orders however people still have to make trips for work or to acquire essential goods To better understand how these necessary trips influenced changes in individual mobility due to the pandemic this study focused on the relationship between trip frequency and distance to median incomes as well as between trip frequency and distance to supermarket density We made use of the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform as our primary source for GPS travel data to study mobility changes at the county-level across the USA Results showed that trip frequency and distance were significantly different before the outbreak of COVID-19 and during three peak periods of COVID-19 infection Specifically we found the reduction of both frequency and distance of trips is negatively correlated to both median income and supermarket density Thus we conclude that individual choice in adherence to staying-at-home is less dependent on the lockdown measures and more influenced by financial capacity and access to necessary goods and services These findings could help inform policy development and programmatic responses to help people reduce their mobility For example government authorities might consider monthly stimulus or other financial support programs that would allow people greater access to delivery services In the future urban planners and policymakers should address the root causes that lead to such economic disparities and food insecurities in order to build resilience in the face of possible future pandemics

15,2,[TITLE] Food insecurity food environments and disparities in diet quality and obesity in a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older Americans [KEYWORDS] Diet quality Food access Healthy Eating Index Obesity risk Older adults Social and environmental factors [ABSTRACT] Food insecurity reflecting a households low ability to purchase healthy food is a public health concern that is associated with poor diet and obesity Poor food environments characterized as a neighborhood with low access to healthy affordable food may amplify the negative impact of food insecurity on diet and obesity This study aims to investigate whether food insecurity and food environments are jointly associated with an increased risk of poor diet quality and obesity We used data from a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults in the Health and Retirement Study Health Care and Nutrition Survey and the National Neighborhood Data Archive to investigate the role of household and neighborhood characteristics on diet and obesity Weighted regression models were estimated to examine the relationship between food insecurity and food environments as well as their interaction with diet quality and obesity Food insecure respondents had lower Healthy Eating Index scores and were more likely to be obese than food secure respondents Living in a poor food environment was associated with lower Healthy Eating Index scores but not with obesity We did not find any interaction between food insecurity and food environment in determining either healthy eating or obesity Reducing food insecurity and increasing access to healthy food environments may encourage healthier eating among older adults while alleviating food-related hardship may also reduce their obesity risk
16,2,[TITLE] Heterogeneity in grocery shopping patterns among low-income minority women in public housing [KEYWORDS] Food access Grocery shopping Low-income women Public housing [ABSTRACT] Background Public housing residents who tend to be predominantly female and racialethnic minorities are at a particularly high risk for chronic health conditions Prior studies have suggested that a lack of access to healthy and affordable food may be an important barrier in public housing communities but evidence is mixed on the association between the neighborhood food environment and dietary quality suggesting the need to examine food access patterns in low-income minority communities more deeply The purpose of this study was to examine the variability in grocery shopping patterns and the factors that predict them among low-income minority women in public housing Methods Interviewer-administered surveys and body composition measurements were collected in the Watts Neighborhood Health Study an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of low-income urban public housing residents located in South Los Angeles Descriptive analyses were conducted to understand the variation in grocery shopping patterns among women Logistic and ordered logistic regression models were estimated to examine the association between resident characteristics and grocery shopping patterns Results There was considerable variability in grocery shopping patterns including the types of grocery stores accessed distance travelled frequency of shopping and reasons behind grocery store choice Grocery shopping patterns were associated with several participant characteristics including raceethnicity working status access to a car income and education Hispanic participants were less likely to shop at a supermarket travel further distances to shop shop more frequently and were more likely to prioritize price in their choice of primary grocery store than non-Hispanic Black women participants Conclusions There was considerable variability in grocery shopping patterns even within this low-income minority community despite access to the same neighborhood food environment Convenience and quality in addition to price were priorities for choice of primary grocery store and differences by raceethnicity suggest that initiatives to improve the neighborhood food environment should consider quality of food cultural factors and availability of foods desired by the surrounding community in addition to price and proximity of grocery stores
17,2,[TITLE] The hidden land use cost of upscaling cover crops [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Cover cropping is considered a cornerstone practice in sustainable agriculture however little attention has been paid to the cover crop production supply chain In this Perspective we estimate land use requirements to supply the United States maize production area with cover crop seed finding that across 18 cover crops on average 38 median 20 of current production area would be required with the popular cover crops rye and hairy vetch requiring as much as 45 and 119 respectively The latter land requirement is comparable to the annual amount of maize grain lost to disease in the US We highlight avenues for reducing these high land use costs
18,2,[TITLE] Predictive genotype-phenotype relations using genetic diversity in African yam bean Sphenostylis stenocarpa Hochst ex A Rich Harms [KEYWORDS] Africa yam bean Genetic diversity Genotyping Phenotype RAD SNP markers [ABSTRACT] Background African Yam Bean AYB is an understudied and underutilized tuberous legume of tropical West and Central African origin In these geographical regions both seeds and tubers of AYB are important components of peoples diets and a potential target as a nutritional security crop The understanding of the genetic diversity among AYB accessions is thus an important component for both conservation and potential breeding programs Results In this study 93 AYB accessions were obtained from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture IITA genebank and genotyped using 3722 SNP markers based on Restriction site-Associated DNA sequencing RAD-Seq Genetic data was analysed using multiple clustering methods for better understanding the distribution of genetic diversity across the population Substantial genetic variability was observed in the present set of AYB accessions and different methodologies demonstrated that these accessions are divided into three to four main groups The accessions were also analysed for important agronomic traits and successfully associated with their genetic clusters where great majority of accessions shared a similar phenotype Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first study on predicting genotypic-phenotypic diversity relationship analysis in AYB From a breeding perspective we were able to identify specific diverse groups with precise phenotype such as seed or both seed and tuber yield purpose accessions These results provide novel and important insights to support the utilization of this germplasm in AYB breeding programs

25,3,[TITLE] Cognitive decline sensory impairment and the use of audio-visual aids by long-term care facility residents [KEYWORDS] Cognitive decline Hearing aid Hearing impairment Visual aids Visual impairment [ABSTRACT] Background Hearing and vision impairments and the use of audio-visual aids are associated with cognitive decline in community-dwelling older people but effects in long-term care facilities LFCF are unclear We hypothesize that visual and hearing impairment are associated with cognitive decline and these relationships are mediated by using visual and hearing aids Methods Secondary data analysis of a longitudinal study was conducted in the 7 government-subsidized LTCF operated by one of the largest non-governmental organizations in Hong Kong using data between 2005 and 2016 Eligible residents were  60years of age without severe cognitive impairment at baseline who had stayed in the facilities for more than 3 years All variables were measured by using the Minimum Data Set-Resident Assessment Instrument Version 20 Hong Kong version The outcome was cognitive decline Predictors were visual and hearing impairments Mediators were the use of visual and hearing aids General linear models were employed to test the hypotheses Results Results for 2233 residents were analyzed with a mean age of 821  82years and a mean follow-up period of 44  08years Results showed that those who had visual impairment p  0004 and hearing impairments p  0022 had a higher risk of cognitive decline Using hearing aids coefficient  00186 p  005 positively mediates the effect of hearing impairment on cognitive decline Using visual aids coefficient  -00881 p  005 negatively mediates the effects of visual impairment on cognitive decline Conclusion In LTCF hearing and visual impairments are associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline Hearing aids often-users were associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline LTCF residents with visual impairment did not use visual aids Use of visual aids demonstrated potential effects in slowing cognitive decline A future study with a larger and more diverse sample with attention to quality of devices is proposed to confirm its effects
26,3,[TITLE] Best practices for community-based overdose education and naloxone distribution programs results from using the Delphi approach [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Background Opioid-related overdose deaths have surged in the USA over the last two decades Overdose fatalities are preventable with the timely administration of naloxone Syringe service programs SSP have pioneered community-based naloxone distribution through overdose prevention and naloxone distribution OEND programs There is a dearth of information with regards to best practices for community-based OEND Methods We utilized a modified Delphi approach to develop a set of best practices for OEND delivery Starting with an initial list of best practices we engaged 27 experts in the field of OEND programming who reviewed made recommendations for changes and assigned a priority to each best practice Results Two rounds of input resulted in a final list of 20 best practices organized into four categories The mean priority scores ranged from 117 to 217 range 1 to 3 The top 5 ranked best practices were ensuring that SSP participants have low barrier consistent needs-based access to naloxone and that there is ample naloxone available within communities While the remaining fifteen best practices were deemed important they had more to do with organizational culture and implementation climate Conclusions Increasing community-based OEND delivery is essential to reduce opioid overdose deaths however it will be insufficient to add programs without an eye toward quality of implementation and fidelity to the model upon which the evidenceis based This list of best practices summarizes the consensus among OEND experts and can serve as a tool for SSPs providing OEND programming to improve services

35,4,[TITLE] School Climate Cortical Structure and Socioemotional Functioning Associations across Family Income Levels [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] School climates are important for childrens socioemotional development and may also serve as protective factors in the context of adversity Nevertheless little is known about the potential neural mechanisms of such associations as there has been limited research concerning the relation between school climate and brain structure particularly for brain regions relevant for mental health and socioemotional functioning Moreover it remains unclear whether the role of school climate differs depending on childrens socioeconomic status We addressed these questions in baseline data for 9- to 10-year-olds from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study analytic sample for socioemotional outcomes n  8887 conducted at 21 sites across the United States Cortical thickness cortical surface area and subcortical volume were derived from T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging School climate was measured by youth report and socioemotional functioning was measured by both youth and parent report A positive school climate and higher family income were associated with lower internalizing and externalizing symptoms with no evidence of moderation There were no associations between school climate and cortical thickness or subcortical volume although family income was positively associated with hippocampal volume For cortical surface area however there was both a positive association with family income and moderation There was an interaction between school climate and income for total cortical surface area and locally in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex In all cases there was an unexpected negative association between school climate and cortical surface area in the lower-income group Consequently although the school climate appears to be related to better socioemotional function for all youth findings suggest that the association between a positive school environment and brain structure only emerges in the context of socioeconomic stress and adversity Longitudinal data are needed to understand the role of these neural differences in socioemotional functioning over time

51,6,[TITLE] Policy implementation through performance measurement A study of water pollution remediation in Chinas Huai River Basin [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Performance-oriented management has been proposed as a remedy to policy implementation failure which is a persuasive woe globally Recent scholarship on policy implementation through performance measurement and management focuses on client-oriented services with less attention paid to the inadequacy of performance indicators in covering all desirable policy goals and in incentivizing all government officials in a non-client-oriented service arena for instance environmental governance Based on station-level water quality data before and after the implementation of Chinas Huai River Basin Water Quality Accountability Program we utilize a difference-in-differences DiD method to investigate how various water quality indicators in the Huai River Basin HRB have responded to the new personnel-based performance measurement system which aimed to enhance environmental policy implementation at the local level We show that the program succeeded in motivating government officials to meet targeted indicators but it also led to the worsening of non-targeted ones We also find that the impact of this personnel-based program was sensitive to personal and contextual factors it affected younger local officials more strongly than those who were older and saw a more limited prospect for promotion These findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of the personnel-based measurement system which may be considered by other countries particularly those with authoritarian regimes and significant policy implementation failures At the same time complementary measures such as institutional arrangements that discover and report omitted important performance aspects should be considered to safeguard the possible pitfalls of the system

60,7,[TITLE] Just transition Framing organizing and power-building for decarbonization [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] As fossil fuel activity declines workers and communities dependent upon this activity will face negative economic and social consequences Mitigating these impacts and including socio-economic considerations in the energy transition is often referred to as just transition While there is robust discussion on what is meant by a just transition there is not a uniform definition or vision of what a just transition entails Moreover the dynamics of community-based engagement and advocacy in advancing a just transition is often downplayed This study contributes to the body of just transition research through an analysis of just transition advocacy in the US states of California Kentucky Louisiana and New York that sought to understand what is needed for a just transition and how just transition can be advanced at the state-level While many cross-state comparisons focus on policy regimes this research focused on the underlying balance of community power and the ability to face established interests A key finding of our research is that many of our interviewees noted that the current system of providing power was deeply impacted by the current configuration of economic and political power For them just transition was not just a policy package but a political project The paper begins with a discussion of what is meant by just transition in existing literature We then move into presenting the results of our study with a particular focus on how just transition stakeholders envision the idea and whether they saw just transition as a clean energy transition or something more transformative We conclude with a discussion of how these findings can contribute to better understandings of just transitions the role that community-based advocacy plays in confronting and overcoming entrenched interests and the importance of state-based actions

72,8,[TITLE] Chinas outward foreign direct investment in the Belt and Road Initiative What are the motives for Chinese firms to invest [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Because of the potentially large and important effects of the extremely ambitious Belt and Road Initiative BRI launched by China in late 2013 considerable attention has been given to the motives for and repercussions of the BRI-driven infrastructural projects Yet the non-infrastructural outward foreign direct investment FDI from China to BRI countries which varies quite substantially across different sectors and different countries has not yet received much attention In contrast to some recent studies showing that the massive initiative has increased Chinas total FDI outflows to fellow BRI countries in this paper based on our sector-level difference-in-differences models we find that effect to be statistically insignificant Yet at the same time we provide empirical evidence on the sectoral pattern of Chinas outward FDI before and after 2014 indicating that Chinas FDI outflows to BRI countries have significantly increased in sectors characterized by overcapacity and contributing to pollution in China thereby demonstrating that Chinas BRI-driven outward FDI has been very selective in terms of sectors We confirm these findings with a variety of robustness checks and show that it is BRI countries with relatively low institutional quality that have been more likely to receive these types of FDI from China We thus speculate that Chinese firms have been motivated to place FDI investments in BRI countries for the sake of alleviating Chinas own overcapacity and pollution problems Our findings lead us to suggest that although these sectoral patterns are consistent with the different stages of economic development in which China and its fellow BRI-identified countries find themselves Chinese investors and host country governments should be more concerned with the potential for unwanted side-effects of the FDI investments so that the mutually beneficial effects of the BRI can be sustained into the indefinite future among all countries involved
73,8,[TITLE] The nexus between CO2 emissions energy consumption and economic growth in the US [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] This study investigates the relationship between carbon dioxide CO2 emissions energy consumption and economic growth GDP in the US at the state level during 19972016 This study uses various quantitative approaches including static models as well as dynamic models to measure the impacts of GDP and different types of energy consumption including total non-renewable renewable industrial and residential energy on CO2 emissions across states Results show that a long-run relationship exists among various types of energy consumption and CO2 emissions at the state level for both static and dynamic models Total non-renewable industrial and residential energy consumption have a positive impact on CO2 emissions while renewable energy consumption has a negative relationship with CO2 emissions The findings show an inverted-U shape relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP which provides enough evidence to validate the Environmental Kuznets Curve EKC hypothesis across states The results are robust across states using both static and dynamic models Policy makers may use our findings to define applicable polices to reduce CO2 emissions across US states
74,8,[TITLE] Mortgage Finance and Climate Change Securitization Dynamics in the Aftermath of Natural Disasters [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Using the government-sponsored enterprises sharp securitization rules this paper provides evidence that in the aftermath of natural disasters lenders are more likely to approve mortgages that can be securitized thereby transferring climate risk The identification strategy uses the time-varying conforming loan limits above which the government-sponsored enterprises do not securitize mortgages Natural disasters lead to more securitization right below the limit suggesting an increased option value of securitization A model identified using indirect inference simulates increasing disaster risk without GSEs Mortgage credit supply would decline in flood zones and lenders would have a greater incentive to screen mortgages

88,10,[TITLE] A study of pandemic and stigma effects in removal proceedings [KEYWORDS] COVID-19 pandemic immigration courts judicial decision-making stigma [ABSTRACT] This study examines how a rapid change in social perceptions of a national-origin group triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic influenced immigration judges decision-making in US removal proceedings Using originally compiled court data on removal proceedings decided between 2019 and 2020 we applied a difference-in-differences framework to produce three key findings First consistent with theory of event stigma Chinese respondents experienced a significantly higher removal rate during the early pandemic period Second consistent with theory of associative stigma East and Southeast ESE Asian respondents also experienced a significantly higher removal rate during the early pandemic period Third the removal rate declined for both Chinese and ESE respondents during the later pandemic period but this decline was more gradual and lagged for ESE Asian than for Chinese respondents Finally increases in the number of cases involving Chinese respondents increased the removal rate for ESE Asian respondents during the early months of the pandemic The last two findings suggest that associative or indirect stigmatization may be harder to combat than direct stigmatization owing to the implicit nature of bias underlying associative stigma This study highlights the socially constructed nature of national origin groups and the importance of both direct and indirect stigmatization in the production of social inequality
89,10,[TITLE] The heterogeneous effects of interactions between parents education and MSA level college share on childrens school enrollment [KEYWORDS] High-skilled city Housing affordability Intergenerational mobility Parent education School enrollment [ABSTRACT] This study finds that location matters more for children of parents with low educational attainment than for children of more educated parents Specifically children of parents without a high school diploma are statistically more likely to be enrolled in high schools or colleges in metropolitan statistical areas MSAs where the college graduate share is higher The statistical relationship between a childs school enrollment and the MSAs college graduate share becomes weaker as their parents educational attainment increases We also find that the least educated households are significantly less likely to be homeowners and are more likely to pay greater housing costs as a share of income in cities with higher college graduate shares indicating that these households are paying a high price to live in high-skilled cities Our results imply that the increasing lack of housing affordability in high-skilled cities makes it more difficult for households with less educational attainment to stay in or move to these places contributing to intergenerational education inequality

100,11,[TITLE] Determining thresholds for spatial urban design and transport features that support walking to create healthy and sustainable cities findings from the IPEN Adult study [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] An essential characteristic of a healthy and sustainable city is a physically active population Effective policies for healthy and sustainable cities require evidence-informed quantitative targets We aimed to identify the minimum thresholds for urban design and transport features associated with two physical activity criteria at least 80 probability of engaging in any walking for transport and WHOs target of at least 15 relative reduction in insufficient physical activity through walking The International Physical Activity and the Environment Network Adult known as IPEN study N11 615 14 cities across ten countries provided data on local urban design and transport features linked to walking Associations of these features with the probability of engaging in any walking for transport and sufficient physical activity 150 minweek by walking were estimated and thresholds associated with the physical activity criteria were determined Curvilinear associations of population street intersection and public transport densities with walking were found Neighbourhoods exceeding around 5700 people per km2 100 intersections per km2 and 25 public transport stops per km2 were associated with meeting one or both physical activity criteria Shorter distances to the nearest park were associated with more physical activity We use the results to suggest specific target values for each feature as benchmarks for progression towards creating healthy and sustainable cities
101,11,[TITLE] Towards the automated large-scale reconstruction of past road networks from historical maps [KEYWORDS] Historical GIS Historical maps Land development Road network analysis Spatial data integration Topographic map processing Transportation infrastructure Urbanization [ABSTRACT] Transportation infrastructure such as road or railroad networks represent a fundamental component of our civilization For sustainable planning and informed decision making a thorough understanding of the long-term evolution of transportation infrastructure such as road networks is crucial However spatially explicit multi-temporal road network data covering large spatial extents are scarce and rarely available prior to the 2000s Herein we propose a framework that employs increasingly available scanned and georeferenced historical map series to reconstruct past road networks by integrating abundant contemporary road network data and color information extracted from historical maps Specifically our method uses contemporary road segments as analytical units and extracts historical roads by inferring their existence in historical map series based on image processing and clustering techniques We tested our method on over 300000 road segments representing more than 50000 km of the road network in the United States extending across three study areas that cover 42 historical topographic map sheets dated between 1890 and 1950 We evaluated our approach by comparison to other historical datasets and against manually created reference data achieving F-1 scores of up to 095 and showed that the extracted road network statistics are highly plausible over time ie following general growth patterns We demonstrated that contemporary geospatial data integrated with information extracted from historical map series open up new avenues for the quantitative analysis of long-term urbanization processes and landscape changes far beyond the era of operational remote sensing and digital cartography

107,11,[TITLE] To measure globally aggregate locally Urban land submarkets and biased estimates of the housing stock [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] This article highlights the role of land and housing submarkets in the construction of aggregate house price indexes and in the estimated value of the housing stock We document idiosyncratic house price appreciation and sales volumes across submarkets within metropolitan areas that result in a sample of sold homes that are representative neither of the housing stock nor its appreciation over time Commonly used aggregate price indexes like the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA and Case-Shiller indexes fail to capture these local dynamics and produce indexes and estimates of the value of the stock that are biased Our approach is to build locally-pooled indexes and then weight these local price indexes by their submarkets share of the housing stock to estimate our metropolitan-level index This allows for more accurate movements in urban land prices which is especially important in higher cost land markets We show traditional globally pooled indexes exhibit significant bias This may complicate research that makes use of the traditional house price indexes

124,13,[TITLE] Sensitivity of Erosion-Rate in Permafrost Landscapes to Changing Climatic and Environmental Conditions Based on Lake Sediments From Northwestern Alaska [KEYWORDS] climate-change erosion-rate permafrost sediments temperature vegetation [ABSTRACT] Erosion of landscapes underlaid by permafrost can transform sediment and nutrient fluxes surface and subsurface hydrology soil properties and rates of permafrost thaw thus changing ecosystems and carbon emissions in high latitude regions with potential implications for global climate However future rates of erosion and sediment transport are difficult to predict as they depend on complex interactions between climatic and environmental parameters such as temperature precipitation permafrost vegetation wildfires and hydrology Thus despite the potential influence of erosion on the future of the Arctic and global systems the relations between erosion-rate and these parameters as well as their relative importance remain largely unquantified Here we quantify these relations based on a sedimentary record from Burial Lake Alaska one of the richest datasets of Arctic lake deposits We apply a set of bi- and multi-variate techniques to explore the association between the flux of terrigenous sediments into the lake a proxy for erosion-rate and a variety of biogeochemical sedimentary proxies for paleoclimatic and environmental conditions over the past 25cal ka BP Our results show that erosion-rate is most strongly associated with temperature and vegetation proxies and that erosion-rate decreases with increased temperature pollen-counts and abundance of pollen from shrubs and trees Other proxies such as those associated with fire frequency aeolian dust supply mass wasting and hydrologic conditions play a secondary role The marginal effects of the sedimentary-proxies on erosion-rate are often threshold dependent highlighting the potential for strong non-linear changes in erosion in response to future changes in Arctic conditions

126,13,[TITLE] Confidence levels and likelihood terms in IPCC reports a survey of experts from different scientific disciplines [KEYWORDS] Communication Confidence Expert judgment IPCC Probability Scientific assessment Uncertainty [ABSTRACT] Scientific assessments such as those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC inform policymakers and the public about the state of scientific evidence and related uncertainties We studied how experts from different scientific disciplineswho were authors of IPCC reports interpret the uncertainty language recommended in the Guidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties This IPCC guidance note discusses how to use confidence levels to describe the quality of evidence and scientific agreement as well likelihood terms to describe the probability intervals associated with climate variables We find that 1 physical science experts were more familiar with the IPCC guidance note than other experts and they followed it more often 2 experts confidence levels increased more with perceptions of evidence than with agreement 3 experts estimated probability intervals for climate variables were wider when likelihood terms were presented with medium confidence rather than with high confidence and when seen in context of IPCC sentences rather than out of context and were only partly in agreement with the IPCC guidance note Our findings inform recommendations for communications about scientific evidence assessments and related uncertainties
127,14,[TITLE] Census of heat tolerance among Floridas threatened staghorn corals finds resilient individuals throughout existing nursery populations [KEYWORDS] Acropora cervicornis climate change coral bleaching automated stress system coral reefs coral restoration thermal stress assay [ABSTRACT] The rapid loss of reef-building corals owing to ocean warming is driving the development of interventions such as coral propagation and restoration selective breeding and assisted gene flow Many of these interventions target naturally heat-tolerant individuals to boost climate resilience but the challenges of quickly and reliably quantifying heat tolerance and identifying thermotolerant individuals have hampered implementation Here we used coral bleaching automated stress systems to perform rapid standardized heat tolerance assays on 229 colonies of Acropora cervicornis across six coral nurseries spanning Floridas Coral Reef USA Analysis of heat stress dose-response curves for each colony revealed a broad range in thermal tolerance among individuals approx 25C range in F v F m ED50 with highly reproducible rankings across independent tests r  076 Most phenotypic variation occurred within nurseries rather than between them pointing to a potentially dominant role of fixed genetic effects in setting thermal tolerance and widespread distribution of tolerant individuals throughout the population The identification of tolerant individuals provides immediately actionable information to optimize nursery and restoration programmes for Floridas threatened staghorn corals This work further provides a blueprint for future efforts to identify and source thermally tolerant corals for conservation interventions worldwide
128,14,[TITLE] Persistent domoic acid in marine sediments and benthic infauna along the coast of Southern California [KEYWORDS] Diatoms Food Chain Geologic Sediments Kainic Acid domoic acid kainic acid diatom food chain sediment [ABSTRACT] Blooms of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia occur annually in the Southern California Bight SCB and domoic acid DA associated with these events can contaminate fisheries presenting both human and wildlife health risks Recent studies have suggested that marine sediments may act as a reservoir for DA extending the risk of food web contamination long after water column blooms have ended In this study we conducted a regional assessment of the extent and magnitude of DA in the benthic environment and monthly observations of sediments and benthic infauna at multiple stations over a 16-month period DA was widespread in continental shelf sediments of the SCB The toxin was detected in 54 of all shelf habitats sampled Detectable concentrations ranged from 011 ngg to 136 ngg DA was consistently detected in benthic infauna tissues over the monthly timeseries while the DA concentrations in sediments during the same period were commonly below detection or at low concentrations The presence of DA in the benthic environment did not always have an apparent water column source raising the possibility of lateral transport retentionpreservation in sediments or undetected blooms in subsurface waters In most cases DA was detected in tissues but not in the co-located surface sediments Coarse taxonomic sorting of the infauna revealed that the accumulation of DA varied among taxa We observed that DA was widespread among lower trophic level organisms in this study potentially acting as a persistent source of DA to higher trophic levels in the benthos

133,14,[TITLE] Expression plasticity regulates intraspecific variation in the acclimatization potential of a reef-building coral [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Phenotypic plasticity is an important ecological and evolutionary response for organisms experiencing environmental change but the ubiquity of this capacity within coral species and across symbiont communities is unknown We exposed ten genotypes of the reef-building coral Montipora capitata with divergent symbiont communities to four thermal pre-exposure profiles and quantified gene expression before stress testing 4 months later Here we show two pre-exposure profiles significantly enhance thermal tolerance despite broadly different expression patterns and substantial variation in acclimatization potential based on coral genotype There was no relationship between a genotypes basal thermal sensitivity and ability to acquire heat tolerance including in corals harboring naturally tolerant symbionts which illustrates the potential for additive improvements in coral response to climate change These results represent durable improvements from short-term stress hardening of reef-building corals and substantial cryptic complexity in the capacity for plasticity
134,14,[TITLE] Enhancement of diatom growth and phytoplankton productivity with reduced O2 availability is moderated by rising CO2 [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Many marine organisms are exposed to decreasing O2 levels due to warming-induced expansion of hypoxic zones and ocean deoxygenation DeO2 Nevertheless effects of DeO2 on phytoplankton have been neglected due to technical bottlenecks on examining O2 effects on O2-producing organisms Here we show that lowered O2 levels increased primary productivity of a coastal phytoplankton assemblage and enhanced photosynthesis and growth in the coastal diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii Mechanistically reduced O2 suppressed mitochondrial respiration and photorespiration of T weissflogii but increased the efficiency of their CO2 concentrating mechanisms CCMs effective quantum yield and improved light use efficiency which was apparent under both ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations leading to ocean acidification OA While the elevated CO2 treatment partially counteracted the effect of low O2 in terms of CCMs activity reduced levels of O2 still strongly enhanced phytoplankton primary productivity This implies that decreased availability of O2 with progressive DeO2 could boost re-oxygenation by diatom-dominated phytoplankton communities especially in hypoxic areas with potentially profound consequences for marine ecosystem services in coastal and pelagic oceans

152,16,[TITLE] Seeking justice amidst chaos methods to identify and document individuals implicated in crimes against the Rohingya in August 2017 [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] Background Documenting perpetrators of human rights violations enables effective prosecution and can help prevent future atrocities Doing so calls for collecting reliable data using verifiable and transparent methodology We present methods used to document crimes and identify alleged perpetrators implicated in the 2017 attacks against Rohingya civilians in Myanmar The findings and lessons-learned have relevance to contemporary crises with widespread atrocities Methods A mixed-methods assessment conducted from May to July 2018 included 1 cross-sectional quantitative surveys among leaders of affected hamlets in northern Rakhine State 2 qualitative interviews to record hamlet-level accounts and 3 clinical evaluations of survivors of violence Survey respondents who reported violence and destruction in each hamlet were asked to identify perpetrators of those acts including known role or affiliation The reported names were reviewed for clarity and divergent spellings repeated references were aggregated and the names and roles were analyzed and classified by location and affiliation Results 143 individuals were implicated in atrocities committed across three Northern Rakhine townships Each was independently identified by at least three separate survey respondents as directly committing violence or destruction in their hamlet of origin or as witnessed while fleeing to Bangladesh Two-thirds 69 of identified perpetrators were reported by four or more participants and 47 by five or more Some form of additional identifying information was provided for 85 of names The most common affiliations were Myanmar army n  40 Border Guard Police n  32 Village Tract Administrators n  17 and extremists n  25 Conclusions The methodology presented here yielded a unique record of individuals purported to have directly committed acts of violence and destruction in Rakhine State in August 2017 forming the most extensive record of individuals implicated in ground-level perpetration of those crimes This methodology can play a key role in accountability mechanisms for the Rohingya and in other settings in which perpetrators are many and documentation of their crimes is difficult The use of survey methods and standardized data collection amongst affected populations to comprehensively characterize crimes committed and to identify individuals implicated in those crimes can serve as a key tool in documentation and an important component of accountability
153,16,[TITLE] Childhood Community Risk Factors on Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration and Victimization Among College Students [KEYWORDS] anything related to child abuse anything related to domestic violence child abuse community violence domestic violence violence exposure [ABSTRACT] The study examined the effect of community environments such as community cohesion community safety and community poverty in childhood on the likelihood of Intimate Partner Violence IPV perpetration and victimization in young adulthood The study used the cross-sectional survey data of 2082 college students collected in 20162017 from six universities in the US and the data for the childhood community environment from the 20072011 American Community Survey Hierarchical regressions were performed separately by gender to 1 assess the effects of community factors in addition to individual factors for IPV perpetration and victimization and to 2 identify the interaction effect of community cohesion with community poverty on IPV perpetration and victimization Community factors of community cohesion and community poverty were significantly correlated to different types of IPV For IPV perpetration only community cohesion was significant for the interaction effect between community cohesion and poverty showed that higher community cohesion lowered the risk of community poverty on later IPV perpetration in both genders For IPV victimization only female students were affected by community poverty whereas none of the community factors had an impact on male students The findings imply the significance of early interventions and policies strengthening the community environment especially community cohesion for preventing IPV The findings also suggest that assessing risk and protective factors on IPV in multiple contexts during childhood is important to develop effective programs preventing IPV
154,16,[TITLE] Adverse Childhood Experiences and Intimate Partner Violence Findings From a Community Sample of Hispanic Young Adults [KEYWORDS] child abuse dating violence domestic violence intergenerational transmission of trauma [ABSTRACT] In the United States a substantial proportion of the adult population 36 of women and 34 of men from all socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds report experiencing intimate partner violence IPV over the life course Family risk factors have been linked to adolescent and young adult IPV involvement yet few studies have examined the effect of multiple co-occurring adverse childhood experiences ACEs in the stability and change of IPV behaviors over young adulthoodthe period of highest risk for IPV We investigated the relationship between the degree of ACE exposure and IPV victimization and perpetration at age 22 and two years later at age 24 among a sample of Hispanic young adults N 1273 in Southern California Negative binomial regression models compared the incident rate ratio IRR of past-year verbal and physical IPV victimization and perpetration of respondents with 13 ACE and with 4 ACE to their peers who reported no history of ACE cross-sectionally age 22 and longitudinally age 24 At age 22 participants with 13 and 4 ACE were overrepresented in all IPV behaviors and had higher IRRs of verbal and physical victimization and perpetration compared to their peers with no ACE By age 24 respondents with a history of 4 ACE were at significantly greater risk for escalating IPV behaviors over this time period than their peers with 13 ACE and no ACE These findings highlight the importance of investing in coordinated efforts to develop strategies that help young people cope with the downstream effects of early life adversity Research should continue to identify what individual community and cultural assets that promote resilience and are promising foci of IPV prevention approaches among vulnerable populations
155,16,[TITLE] Sexual violence victimization among American college students studying abroad [KEYWORDS] Alcohol drinking foreign countries sexual assault study abroad [ABSTRACT] Objective Research has just begun to identify American college students who study abroad as a group at-risk for sexual violence victimization The purpose of the current study was to examine the context of these incidents Participants We utilized a large longitudinal sample of 2428 United States college students studying abroad for between 4 and 21 weeks in 12 different foreign countries Methods We estimated descriptive statistics and logistic regression models to assess prevalence and correlates of sexual victimization abroad as well as effect size comparisons to quantify changes in drinking abroad Results Over one-fifth of students experienced sexual violence while abroad including sexual assault and verbal coercion Women younger students those who experienced sexual violence prior and heavier drinkers had the greatest odds of sexual violence victimization abroad Conclusions Findings point to the need for evidence-based programming to reduce sexual violence risk among American college students studying in foreign countries
156,16,[TITLE] Industry-Dominated Science Advisory Boards Are Perceived To Be LegitimateBut Only When They Recommend More Stringent Risk Management Policies [KEYWORDS] Decision making EPA legitimacy procedural justice risk management [ABSTRACT] In 2017 the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA was criticized for two controversial directives that restricted the eligibility of academic scientists to serve on the agencys key science advisory boards SABs The EPA portrayed these directives as necessary to ensure the integrity of the SAB Critics portrayed them as a tactic by the agency to advance a more industry-friendly deregulatory agenda With this backdrop this research examined board composition and its effect on the perceived legitimacy of risk management recommendations by the SAB In an experiment we presented participants with hypothetical EPA SABs composed of different proportions of academic and industry scientists We then asked participants to rate their satisfaction with and the legitimacy of these boards in light of their decisions in scenarios based on actual EPA SAB deliberations Participants perceived higher levels of satisfaction and legitimacy when SABs made more stringent risk management recommendations While SABs dominated by industry scientists were perceived to be more strongly motivated to protect business interests we found no effect of board composition on perceptions of satisfaction and legitimacy These results are consistent with prior research on decision quality that suggests people use normative outcomes as a heuristic for assessing the quality of deliberations Moreover these results suggest that members of the public are supportive of federal SABs regardless of their composition but only if they take actions that are consistent with normative expectations
157,16,[TITLE] An applied environmental justice framework for exposure science [KEYWORDS] Environmental health Environmental justice Exposure science Health studies Marginalized communities [ABSTRACT] On the 30th anniversary of the Principles of Environmental Justice established at the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 Principles of Environmental Justice we continue to call for these principles to be more widely adopted We propose an environmental justice framework for exposure science to be implemented by all researchers This framework should be the standard and not an afterthought or trend dismissed by those who believe that science should not be politicized Most notably this framework should be centered on the community it seeks to serve Researchers should meet with community members and stakeholders to learn more about the community involve them in the research process collectively determine the environmental exposure issues of highest concern for the community and develop sustainable interventions and implementation strategies to address them Incorporating community funds of knowledge will also inform the study design by incorporating the knowledge about the issue that community members have based on their lived experiences Institutional and funding agency funds should also be directed to supporting community needs both during the active research phase and at the conclusion of the research such as mechanisms for dissemination capacity building and engagement with policymakers This multidirectional framework for exposure science will increase the sustainability of the research and its impact for long-term success
158,16,[TITLE] Pollution and health a progress update [KEYWORDS]  [ABSTRACT] The Lancet Commission on pollution and health reported that pollution was responsible for 9 million premature deaths in 2015 making it the worlds largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death We have now updated this estimate using data from the Global Burden of Diseases Injuriaes and Risk Factors Study 2019 We find that pollution remains responsible for approximately 9 million deaths per year corresponding to one in six deaths worldwide Reductions have occurred in the number of deaths attributable to the types of pollution associated with extreme poverty However these reductions in deaths from household air pollution and water pollution are offset by increased deaths attributable to ambient air pollution and toxic chemical pollution ie lead Deaths from these modern pollution risk factors which are the unintended consequence of industrialisation and urbanisation have risen by 7 since 2015 and by over 66 since 2000 Despite ongoing efforts by UN agencies committed groups committed individuals and some national governments mostly in high-income countries little real progress against pollution can be identified overall particularly in the low-income and middle-income countries where pollution is most severe Urgent attention is needed to control pollution and prevent pollution-related disease with an emphasis on air pollution and lead poisoning and a stronger focus on hazardous chemical pollution Pollution climate change and biodiversity loss are closely linked Successful control of these conjoined threats requires a globally supported formal sciencepolicy interface to inform intervention influence research and guide funding Pollution has typically been viewed as a local issue to be addressed through subnational and national regulation or occasionally using regional policy in higher-income countries Now however it is increasingly clear that pollution is a planetary threat and that its drivers its dispersion and its effects on health transcend local boundaries and demand a global response Global action on all major modern pollutants is needed Global efforts can synergise with other global environmental policy programmes especially as a large-scale rapid transition away from all fossil fuels to clean renewable energy is an effective strategy for preventing pollution while also slowing down climate change and thus achieves a double benefit for planetary health
