,yes,Article,"Altman, Scott",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,"Altman, Scott",,57202977716,Selling Silence: The Morality of Sexual Harassment,"This article argues against enforcing sexual harassment nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). Although NDAs guard privacy, facilitate settlement, and compensate victims, they also help repeat perpetrators avoid detection and punishment, endangering future victims and undermining efforts to combat sexual harassment. Advocates argue that victims have no duty to prevent these harms, given the risks and trauma of reporting. I offer three responses. First, although most victims have no duty to speak, some victims might come to have such a duty. The state should not help them commit to violating a future duty. Second, some initially reticent victims may later want to disclose. The state should not enforce promises not to do supererogatory acts. Third, NDAs make victims complicit with the perpetrator's future harassment and wrongful efforts to avoid social punishment. If perpetrators refuse to compensate victims adequately without NDAs, we should increase victim compensation rather than enforce NDAs. Accused harassers might claim they need NDAs to guard against wrongful or excessive social punishment. For guilty perpetrators, NDAs resemble felony expungement statutes. However, arguments for expungement do not apply to NDAs. Although falsely accused people have legitimate privacy interests, NDAs are an excessively broad way to protect this interest.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/japp.12590,2022,Journal of Applied Philosophy,39,4,,698,720,,https://doi.org/10.1111/japp.12590,saltman@law.usc.edu,Yes

Anca Gheaus and James Dwyer argue that children should be reared by the best available parent, who, in turn, should make choices based only on children’s welfare. They claim that love and respect require this fiduciary stance. However, love and respect do not justify child-centered norms. If children were competent, they would embrace norms that accommodate parental interests because they benefit from nonfiduciary rules, are grateful to their parents, and reject discrimination produced by child-centered principles. Furthermore, child-centered accounts imply unreasonably broad obligations to children.",https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/722128,2023,Ethics,133,2,,271,85,,https://doi.org/10.1086/722128,saltman@law.usc.edu,No
,yes,Article,"Altman, Scott",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,57202977716,Are Parents Fiduciaries?,"Parents resemble trustees, conservators, and other fiduciaries; they exercise broad discretion while making choices for vulnerable people. Like other fiduciaries, parents can be tempted to neglect their duties or pursue self-interest at the expense of those they should protect. This article argues against treating parents as fiduciaries for three reasons. First, the scope of parental fiduciary duties cannot be narrowed enough to make them tolerable. Arguments limiting fiduciary duties to cases where parents exercise delegated powers or act within parenting roles fail. Most parental decisions involve dual powers or roles. Efforts to address these dual-role cases produce principles that are unduly demanding, complex, arbitrary, and morally unappealing. Second, we could limit parental fiduciary duties by designing parental roles to benefit children. Since children need devoted, happy, well-rounded parents, the principle of designing parental roles to benefit children would produce rules that leave room for parents to flourish. However, this principle does not justify specific legal or moral fiduciary norms. Third, we could redefine fiduciary duties so parents can balance their interests against children’s interests, making fiduciary duties less burdensome. However, expanding the definition of fiduciary threatens to encompass many duties within the fiduciary category, rendering the description almost meaningless.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10982-022-09468-4,2023,Law and Philosophy,42,5,,411,435,411-435,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10982-022-09468-4,saltman@law.usc.edu,No
,yes,Article,"Altman, Scott",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,57202977716,A Right to Adopt and Parental Licensing,"No court recognizes the right to adopt a child. By contrast, we embrace family formation rights and protect choices about whether to marry, procreate, and rear biological children. These rights are needed because families play a key role in society and family formation is central to a happy and self-directed life. For similar reasons, we should recognize the right to adopt and stop aggressively screening adoptive parents in ways we would not tolerate for biological parents.

Some advocates of child-centered morality think we should equalize the treatment of adoptive and biological parents in the opposite way—scrutinizing biological parents' homes like adoptive homes and requiring people to get a license before rearing children.

I argue against these positions. Parental licensing would exacerbate the discrimination in our child welfare system, prevent too many non-abusive parents from forming families, and harm more children than it helps. Aggressive adoption screening is wrong for the same reasons: it discriminates, deprives many prospective parents of a chance to form families, and harms more children than it helps. Arguments to the contrary based on child-centered morality, or practical differences between adoption and procreation, are unpersuasive.",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4340764,2023,Arizona Law Review,65,4,,835,875,,https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4340764,saltman@law.usc.edu,Yes

national government budgets, even though constituent needs remain pressing. In
desperation, public officials sometimes replenish public coffers through illicit
extraction from segments of the population poorly positioned to fight back. In
Detroit, for example, city officials inflated property tax assessments in violation of
the Michigan Constitution, leading to illegally inflated property taxes that many
homeowners could not afford to pay. Consequently, since 2009, one in three homes
have completed the property tax foreclosure process, the highest number of property
tax foreclosures in American history since the Great Depression. These
unlawful practices are not just occurring in Detroit, but also in other American
cities such as Ferguson, Philadelphia, and New Orleans.


Nevertheless, because corruption is universally defined as corrupt acts that are for
private or personal gain, there is currently no lexicon to describe illegal acts that
principally benefit the public treasury. I have coined the term “stategraft” to
describe this overlooked phenomenon: when state agents transfer property from
persons to the state in violation of the state’s own laws or basic human rights. To
establish stategraft as an essential theoretical framework, this Article elaborates its

This same principle can anticipate the policy preferences of national jurisdictions that specialize in the chip-design or device-production segments of the global technology supply chain. Consistent with this principle, the legal treatment of SEP licensing and enforcement by regulators and courts in the People’s Republic of China reflects a strategic effort to deploy competition and patent law to reduce input costs for domestic device producers that rely on wireless communications technology held by foreign chip suppliers. This mercantilist use of antitrust law has derived its intellectual foundation from patent holdup and royalty stacking models of market failure developed principally by U.S. scholars and has borrowed excessive pricing, essential facility, and other doctrines from E.U. competition and U.S. antitrust law, which have then been applied expansively by Chinese regulators and courts in service of geopolitical objectives.

We demonstrate that this principle is fundamentally incomplete.

In many industries, collaborating with rivals is important. Firms in such “Collaborative Industries” are interdependent, and they can use their interdependence to collude. Reducing market concentration does not change this dynamic, and thus does not prevent collusion. Worse, if smaller firms depend on collaboration more than larger ones do, reducing market concentration can actually encourage collusion.

Antitrust enforcers have observed that Collaborative Industries are more prone to collusion. Yet conventional economic models, and the antitrust laws and policies built upon them, do not reflect Collaborative Industries’ dynamics.

But recently, a wave of critics has argued not only that efficiency is less important, but that efficiency analysis itself is fundamentally flawed. Some say that efficiency is incoherent because there is no neutral baseline from which to judge inefficiency. Others say that efficiency is biased toward those best able to pay (generally, the rich). This essay contends that efficiency is not meaningfully incoherent or biased. The most widely discussed forms of efficiency do not require any particular baseline, and even those that do require a baseline can still serve as useful approximations of more theoretically sound but computationally demanding measures. Moreover, arguments of bias do not account for the source of funds in public projects, produce unintuitive results, and draw an arbitrary cutoff between bias and non-bias that elides important distributional details.

Over the past several decades, an increasingly conservative US Supreme Court has narrowly construed the project of equality law. It has marginalized theories of indirect discrimination and narrowed the scope of permissible remedial programmes that identify beneficiaries based on race. It is generally sceptical of statistical evidence of discrimination. These developments have rendered US civil rights law ill-equipped to address the disparate effects of Covid-19 based on race, gender, and other social categories. But more capacious understandings of equality have continued to influence US policy-makers, acting through legislatures, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. These more capacious understandings of equality have inspired data collection efforts to identify disparities, to explore the causes and consequences of these disparities, and to design interventions to mitigate them. To avoid legal challenge, interventions to mitigate disparities are crafted to avoid the perception of zero-sum conflict with majority group interests. Over the longer term, as public policy approaches to equality are proven effective, they may inform legal developments, hastening the demise of legal rules that are out of sync with new understandings of what equality demands.",https://academic.oup.com/book/45350/chapter-abstract/389265953?redirectedFrom=fulltext,2023,Exponential Inequalities: Equality Law in Times of Crisis,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780192872999.003.0009,jclarke@law.usc.edu,No
,yes,Book Chapter,"Clarke, Jessica",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,42761174000,Sex Discrimination Formalism,"Critics of antidiscrimination law have long lamented that the Supreme Court is devoted to a shallow, formal version of equality that fails to account for substantive inequities and stands in the way of affirmative efforts to remediate systemic injustice. But these criticisms are primarily focused on the Supreme Court’s interpretations of race discrimination law. The Court’s most recent foray into statutory sex discrimination law, Bostock v. Clayton County, employed formalistic reasoning to move the law in an expansive direction, interpreting Title VII’s sex discrimination provision to prohibit discrimination against lesbian, gay, and transgender employees. Examining post-Bostock developments, this Article asks whether formal equality might have more potential to advance civil rights than previously thought. It argues that “formal equality” is not a single legal inquiry; rather, in practice, it takes the form of at least three distinct tests. These tests lead to different results in different sex discrimination controversies, such as whether it is discrimination to treat someone adversely for being bisexual or nonbinary; to single out pregnancy, menstruation, breasts, or other aspects of reproductive biology for disparate treatment; to enforce sex-specific dress codes; to exclude transgender people from restrooms consistent with their gender identities; to ban gender-affirming health care; or to restrict who can change the sex designations on their identity documents. Although no formal test neatly maps onto prevailing normative theories and sociological insights about what discrimination is, in recent cases, courts have used formal tests to achieve results consistent with those theories. This account suggests that, rather than insisting that courts adopt substantive tests, civil rights scholars might reconsider the virtues of formalism.

The United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) articulate societal aspirations for people and our planet. Many scientists have criticised the SDGs and some have suggested that a better understanding of the complex interactions between society and the environment should underpin the next global development agenda. We further this discussion through the theory of social–ecological resilience, which emphasises the ability of systems to absorb, adapt, and transform in the face of change. We determine the strengths of the current SDGs, which should form a basis for the next agenda, and identify key gaps that should be filled.

Technical summary
The United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) are past their halfway point and the next global development agenda will soon need to be developed. While laudable, the SDGs have received strong criticism from many, and scholars have proposed that adopting complex adaptive or social–ecological system approaches would increase the effectiveness of the agenda. Here we dive deeper into these discussions to explore how the theory of social–ecological resilience could serve as a strong foundation for the next global sustainable development agenda. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current SDGs by determining which of the 169 targets address each of 43 factors affecting social–ecological resilience that we have compiled from the literature. The SDGs with the strongest connections to social–ecological resilience are the environment-focus goals (SDGs 2, 6, 13, 14, 15), which are also the goals consistently under-prioritised in the implementation of the current agenda. In terms of the 43 factors affecting social–ecological resilience, the SDG strengths lie in their communication, inclusive decision making, financial support, regulatory incentives, economic diversity, and transparency in governance and law. On the contrary, ecological factors of resilience are seriously lacking in the SDGs, particularly with regards to scale, cross-scale interactions, and non-stationarity.

Social media summary
The post-2030 agenda should build on strengths of SDGs 2, 6, 13, 14, 15, and fill gaps in scale, variability, and feedbacks.

Fish and whales are among the “last wild food”—that is, species that humans take directly from the wild for food purposes. While whales are primarily cultural food, fisheries remain important contributors to the human diet globally. Indeed, the food security issues surrounding marine foods are increasingly being recognized as an important international and domestic component of human well-being and equity. These concerns helped to spur the fall 2021 launch of the Blue Foods movement and the conscious incorporation of aquatic foods into the pursuit of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.

At the same time, changes in the ocean resulting from climate change and other anthropogenic forces are making the commercial harvest of marine wild foods increasingly unsustainable, simultaneously undermining ocean ecosystem function, marine biodiversity, and human food security. Humanity’s continued engagement in industrial-scale commercial marine fisheries is thus both factually uncertain and ethically suspect.

This Article explores the multilayered ethical issues surrounding Blue Foods in the Anthropocene, drawing from Stone’s work in environmental ethics and “Moral Pluralism.” Finding a balance between protecting the world’s marine ecosystems and appropriately promoting the ocean’s contribution to global food security remains an important policy challenge for the twenty-first century, but it is one that nations can meet by privileging indigenous and local fisheries while simultaneously carefully expanding the more environmentally benign forms of marine aquaculture, particularly shellfish and kelp aquaculture.

before vaccines became widely available, required individuals to be able to
access fresh water while remaining isolated from most of their fellow human

two million Americans who lacked access to reliable indoor running water, these
COVID-19 measures presented a considerable added challenge on top of the
existing risks to their health from an insecure water supply.
Many of these people were Native Americans, whose Tribes often lack fully
adjudicated, quantified, and deliverable rights to fresh water. To highlight the
critical role that water rights played in Tribes’ capacities to cope with the
pandemic, this essay compares the Klamath Tribes in Oregon, who after 40
years of litigation have relatively securely established themselves as the senior
water rights holders in the Klamath River Basin, to the Diné (Navajo Nation),
whose reservation—the largest in the United States—covers well over 27,500
square miles of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico but largely lacks quantified
water rights or the means to deliver water to households. While access to water
was not the sole factor in these two Tribes’ vastly different experiences with

That decision was never completely comfortable, and over time it has become clear that, although the two permit programs serve the same regulatory goal of improving water quality, they otherwise resonate in two very different complexes of legal values. The U.S. Supreme Court repeatedly has found the Section 404 complex particularly troublesome, holding that a broad definition of “waters of the United States” in this program threatens to infringe both states’ Tenth Amendment prerogatives and landowners’ private property rights. Moreover, this narrowing of jurisdictional “waters of the United States” is likely to continue into the 2022-2023 Supreme Court term through the case of Sackett v. EPA.

The intense legal and political focus on “waters of the United States” since at least the Court’s 2006 decision in Rapanos v. United States has obscured the fact that Clean Water Act jurisdiction depends on five elements, not just that one, that must be evaluated together. Moreover, the Supreme Court’s approach to Section 402 jurisdiction in its 2020 decision in County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund counsels the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take a more holistic approach to their next round of Clean Water Act jurisdictional regulations.

A year later, Lake Mead operations worsened to a Tier 2a shortage, which governs operations through 2023. Implementation of this shortage standard according to the Colorado Basin states’ 2019 Drought Contingency Plan means that Arizona reduced its normal 2.8 million acre-feet allocation from the Colorado River by 592,000 acre-feet in 2023, losing “approximately 21% of the state’s annual apportionment”; Nevada reduced its normal allocation of 300,000 acre-feet by 25,000 acre-feet, “which is 8% of the state’s annual apportionment”; and Mexico received reduced its allocation of 1.5 million acre-feet by 104,000 acre-feet, “which is approximately 7% of the country’s annual allotment.”

California, in contrast, continues—at least for the moment—to receive its full non-drought share of the Colorado River, or 4.4 million acre-feet. This relative insulation from Colorado River drought is the latest manifestation of California exceptionalism under the Law of the River.

,yes,Article,"Gruber, Aya",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,Gould9,Sex Exceptionalism in Criminal Law,"Sex crimes are the worst crimes. People generally believe that sexual assault is graver than nonsexual assault, uninvited sexual compliments are worse than nonsexual insults, and sex work is different from work. Criminal codes typically create a dedicated category for sex offenses, uniting under its umbrella conduct ranging from violent attacks to consensual commercial transactions. This exceptionalist treatment of sex as categorically different rarely elicits discussion, much less debate. Sex exceptionalism, however, is neither natural nor neutral, and its political history should give us pause. This Article is the first to trace, catalog, and analyzesex exceptionalism in criminal law in the United States. Through a genealogical examination of sex-crime law from the late eighteenth century to today, it makes several novel contributions to the debate over how criminal law should regulate sex.

First, this Article casts doubt on the conventional account that rape law’s history is solely one of sexist tolerance, an account that undergirds contemporary calls for broader criminal regulations and higher sentences. In fact, early law established rape as the most heinous crime and a fate worse than death, but it did so to preserve female chastity, marital morality, and racial supremacy. Sex-crime laws were not uniformly underenforced but rather selectively enforced—a tool used to entrench hierarchies and further oppressive regimes from slavery to social purity.

Second, this Article employs this history to suggest that it is past time to critically examine whether sex crimes should be exceptional. Indeed, in the 1960s and 1970s, the enlightened liberal position was that rape law should be less exceptional and harmonized with the law governing “ordinary” assault.

Third, this Article spotlights the invisible but powerful influence sex exceptionalism exerts on scholarship and advocacy. Sex exceptionalism has flourished despite the liberal critique, and today it is adopted without hesitation. Sex dazzles theorists of all types. For sex crimes, retributivists accept exorbitant sentences, utilitarians tolerate ineffective ones, and critics of mass incarceration selectively abandon their principled stance against expanding the penal state. Denaturalizing sex exceptionalism and excavating its troubling origins forces analysts to confront a detrimental frame underlying society’s perpetual enthusiasm for punitive sex regulation.",https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/print/article/sex-exceptionalism-in-criminal-law/,2023,Stanford Law Review,75,4,,755,846,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4167887,agruber@law.usc.edu,Yes

Carceral feminism does not denote a discrete group of feminists but the fact that criminalization is a stubbornly persistent feature of feminist agendas. I argue that the penal system is a colonial institution born of Indigenous displacement, Black enslavement, and capitalist exploitation. The American carceral state is a colonial institution at its core, and it serves to maintain colonial domination – it cannot be decolonized; it can only be dismantled. The chapter examines how feminists have participated in the American colonial prison project by sanitizing state violence as the protection of vulnerable women and silencing anti-carceral Black and Indigenous people, people of colour, and socialist feminists. Challenging carceral approaches to women’s safety is essential to the project of decolonizing justice and the chapter concludes by suggesting how feminists can purge carceral programmes, practices, and logics from their gender-justice-seeking agendas.",https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003176619-25/colonial-carceral-feminism-aya-gruber,2023,The Routledge International Handbook on Decolonizing Justice,,,,,,,not found,agruber@law.usc.edu,Yes

Over the years, scholars from outside and within feminism have offered various historical, philosophical, and genealogical analyses of the feminist movement’s relationship to mass incarceration. These writings assert that powerful feminist ideologies and groups contributed materially to the growth of the criminal punishment system and served as powerful legitimators of penal authority in the last several decades. Critics of “carceral feminism” argue that feminists collaborated with the carceral state, often unintentionally, by among other things cementing raced and gendered narratives of crime victimhood, giving bipartisan credence to policing and prosecution programs, reinforcing the notion that the criminal system “works,” and bolstering the neoliberal precept that violence stems from individual choices rather than structural conditions.",https://openyls.law.yale.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13051/18248/55.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,2023,Yale Journal of Law and Feminism,34,2,,,,,not found,agruber@law.usc.edu,Yes
,yes,Article,"Gruber, Aya",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,Gould9,A Tale of Two Me Toos,"What is #MeToo’s legacy? The conventional account currently being indelibly forged into our collective memory is that #MeToo was an unconditional progressive victory. It was a reckoning of the disempowered against the powerful that profoundly challenged sexist culture. This Article complicates and even counters that narrative by shining a light on #MeToo’s dark side, namely, its carceral and neoliberal messages and policy reforms. Although today’s George-Floyd-mindful feminists often describe #MeToo as having nothing to do with criminal law, the reality is that the movement featured familiar tough-on-crime discourses, passionately called for more criminal law and prosecutorial power, and, in fact, produced several new carceral laws and policies. Yet, just hours after famous actor Alyssa Milano sent the tweet heard around the world, Black Twitter revealed that Me Too already existed: Tarana Burke’s “me too movement.” This Me Too centered on survivors’ material and emotional needs, focused on young women of color living in socioeconomic precarity, and embraced noncriminal “transformative justice.” Milano’s #MeToo, by contrast, incorporated popular narratives of criminality, bolstered the legitimacy of the penal state, and relied on traditional notions of sex and gender. And it was Milano’s that became the Me Too. This Article contrasts the two Me Toos to critique the individualistic and punitive #MeToo movement that is and mourn the intersectional and restorative Me Too movement that could have been. #MeToo’s emphasis on sensational stories and social media-derived evidence of “epidemics” effectively cut off debate, enabling carceral reforms to pass at a dizzying pace. This Article is the first to catalogue, describe, and examine the actual criminal laws and policies erected in #MeToo’s name. Even a surface analysis of these reforms reveals that, contrary to advocates’ claims, they do not just close “loopholes.” Instead, each new or broadened criminal law raises troubling issues of civil liberties, defendants’ rights, and state power, and each portends to sweep in people—including women—who bear little resemblance to the unrepentant monstrous offenders featured in #MeToo discourse.",https://illinoislawreview.org/print/vol-2023-no-5/a-tale-of-two-me-toos/,2023,Illinois Law Review,5,October,,1675,1752,,not found,agruber@law.usc.edu,Yes

,yes,Book Chapter,"Gruber, Aya",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,Gould9,Feminism,"Feminism in the United States (USA) and across the globe has always had a complex, mutually constitutive relationship to criminal law. In recent decades, progressive scholars have argued that the feminist movement—or more specifically the powerful mainstream Western manifestations of it—have been particularly reliant on criminal law and enforcement and curiously sanguine about criminal institutions that were born of hypermasculinity and state violence (Halley et al [2006] 341; Law [2014]). Scholars like Elizabeth Bernstein have observed that, under the influence of powerful U.S. feminists, ‘carceral feminism’ grew worldwide as movements ‘drift[ed] from the welfare state to the carceral state as the enforcement apparatus for feminist goals’ (Bernstein [2007] 143). 

Indeed, every philosophy and social movement, including those preoccupied with social justice, can be said to have contributed to the carceral landscape in one way or another. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to trace the how abstract feminist discourses, theories, and politics became concrete criminal laws and policies. This entry examines some of the internal and external factors that entangled certain schools of feminism with the carceral state, focusing on the experience of the United States. Attempting to formulate a short snapshot of the role of feminism in the evolution of the American penal state is not an easy task. Indeed, the discussion can fill up multiple volumes and is the topic of my 2020 book, The Feminist War on Crime: The Unexpected Role of Women’s Liberation in Mass Incarceration, from which much of the analysis here is borrowed. The story of feminism and criminal law in the United States—as elsewhere—is a rich story of feminists’ simultaneous participation in and resistance to powerful state and private institutions. Feminist reforms that secured justice for women could, at the same time, exacerbate larger inequalities. ",https://www.elgaronline.com/display/book/9781789902990/b-9781789902990.feminism.xml,2023,Elgar Encyclopedia of Crime and Criminal Justice,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4337/9781789902990.feminism,agruber@law.usc.edu,No

Inalienable judgments arise in many contexts, including antitrust, labor law, intellectual property law, unfair competition, and various types of public interest litigation. We show that inalienability systematically creates incentives for problematic rent-seeking behaviors: strategic investments intended to influence the outcome of litigation and collusive ex ante settlements that enrich the parties at the public’s expense. These problems arise because the parties generally have asymmetric stakes, and asymmetric stakes affect strategic behavior differently when judgments are inalienable.

The movement does not emphasize that killing prisoners is inhumane per se. Its focus is almost exclusively on administrative, procedural, and utilitarian issues, such as recurrent exonerations of innocents, incorrigible racial discrimination, endemic arbitrariness, lack of deterrent value, and spiraling financial costs. By comparison, modern European law recognizes any execution as an inherent violation of human rights rooted in dignity. This humanistic approach is often assumed to be “European” in nature and foreign to America, where distinct sensibilities lead people to concentrate on practical problems surrounding executions. This Article demonstrates that, in reality, the significant transatlantic divergence on abolitionism is a relatively recent development. By the late eighteenth century, abolitionists in Europe and America recurrently denounced the inhumanity of executions in language foreshadowing modern human rights norms. Drawing on sources overlooked by scholars, including the views of past American and French abolitionists, the Article shows that reformers previously converged in employing a polyvalent rhetoric blending humanistic and practical objections to executions. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that a major divergence materialized. As America faced an increasingly punitive social climate leading to the death penalty’s resurgence and the rise of mass incarceration, abolitionists largely abandoned humanistic claims in favor of practical ones. Meanwhile, the opposite generally occurred as abolitionism triumphed in Europe. These findings call into question the notion that framing the death penalty as a human rights abuse marks recent shifts in Western Europe or international law. While human rights have indeed become the official basis for abolition in modern Europe, past generations of European and U.S. abolitionists defended similar moral and political convictions. These humanistic norms reflect a long-term evolution traceable to the Renaissance and Enlightenment. But for diverse social transformations, America may have kept converging with Europe in gradually adopting humanistic norms of punishment.",https://academic.oup.com/ajcl/article/71/1/46/7226647,2023,American Journal of Comparative Law,71,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcl/avad011,mjouet@law.usc.edu,Yes

On the tenth anniversary of the ECtHR’s landmark Vinter decision, abolitionism and retentionism characterise its state in Europe. In abolishing irreducible life sentences, Vinter crystallised a long-term evolution in prisoners’ rights since the Enlightenment. Meanwhile, enduring animosity towards prisoners has led to their rights repeatedly becoming the stage for wider debates concerning the legitimacy of European institutions. The United Kingdom’s threats to leave the ECtHR notably enabled it to exempt itself from Vinter. Still, the European project retains numerous supporters, which helps explain why the abolition of life without parole is making progress in continental Europe, as compared to the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

Yet one area of agreement between Democrats and Republicans has received insufficient attention: punitiveness as a means of gun control. The United States has gravitated toward a peculiar social model combining extremely loose regulations on guns and extremely harsh penalties on gun crime. If someone possesses a gun illegally or carries one when committing another crime, such as burglary or drug dealing, draconian mandatory minimums can apply. These circumstances exemplify root causes of mass incarceration: overreliance on prisons in reaction to social problems and unforgiving punishments for those labeled as “violent” criminals. Contrary to widespread misconceptions, mass incarceration does not primarily stem from locking up petty, nonviolent offenders caught in the “War on Drugs.” Most prisoners are serving time for violent offenses. Steep sentence enhancements for crimes involving guns illustrate how American justice revolves around counterproductive, costly practices that disproportionately impact minorities.
This multidisciplinary Article envisions future reforms with the capacity to transcend America’s bitter polarization. A precondition to change is not for conservatives and liberals to wholeheartedly agree on issues like systemic racism or the right to bear arms. Rather, possibilities for penal reform are likelier when each side can come to the negotiating table for its own reasons. A paradigm shift in conservative America may prove especially indispensable, as Republicans tend to be more supportive of harsh punishments, and Democrats are unlikely to achieve reform nationwide on party-line votes. This shift has already occurred to an extent, given the rise of penal reform in red states. But both conservatives and liberals have failed to significantly reduce mass incarceration by recurrently excluding “violent” offenders from reform initiatives.
The Article explores how conservatives and liberals could gradually converge toward sentencing reform on gun crime. This could ultimately have a ripple effect on American sentencing norms, leading them closer to those of Western democracies with more effective and humane penal systems. Such bipartisanship is less elusive than it might seem. A rehabilitative approach toward gun crime fits with the evolution of American conservatism, which believes that guns should not be vilified since they are part of the nation’s identity. Similarly, the rehabilitation of people convicted of gun crime is consistent with cornerstones of modern American liberalism, namely stricter gun control and opposition to mass incarceration as an unjust, racist system. As opposite sides will probably retain much of their worldview even if their perspectives evolve to a degree, new ways of thinking could help bring reformers together. These social transformations cannot be predicted but should be theorized.",https://arizonastatelawjournal.org/2023/08/01/guns-mass-incarceration-and-bipartisan-reform-beyond-vicious-circle-and-social-polarization/,2023,rizona State Law Journal,55,1,,239,290,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=4255881,mjouet@law.usc.edu,Yes

To name just a few: several chapters have been reorganized to address the rise of classical accident law and to clarify how modern tort law develops from it, to update and expand upon limitations on punitive damages, and to clarify the elements of battery and the defenses to battery. Furthermore, the casebook has been shortened and its materials have been focused on those topics addressed in current first-year torts classes.

Lastly, this edition expands the book’s treatment of an emerging area of law: public nuisance. While public nuisance originally landed in the United States along with the rest of the English common law, it owes its contemporary prominence in mass tort litigation to the tobacco suits of the 1990’s. In the wake of the stunning success of the tobacco litigation, ambitious public nuisance claims have proliferated to encompass contemporary social problems such as the public health scourge of lead paint contamination, greenhouse gases, and opioids. This important legal field is comprehensively addressed in the portion of the casebook discussing mechanisms of recovery for increasingly common situations in which many people are put at risk, and many ultimately hurt, by the same tortious conduct.",https://faculty.westacademic.com/Book/Detail?id=2775,2023,,,,,,,,not found,gkeating@law.usc.edu,No

,yes,Book Chapter,"Keating, Gregory C.",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,7005785162,Irreparable Injury and the Limits of the Law of Torts,"Tort law safeguards security by requiring reparation for harm wrongly done. The fact that reparation is the institution’s default remedy limits tort law’s powers. Some harms are simply irreparable. Death is the most vivid case in point. No compensation can restore the dead to the lives they have lost. No remedy can return them to the position that they would have occupied had they not been killed. Faced with this stark truth early modern tort law did not award any damages for wrongful death and contemporary tort law still stops short of awarding damages for the value to those who are wrongly killed of the lives that they have lost. Wrongful death doctrine exposes tort law’s Achilles’ heel. On the one hand, premature death is the harm that we most wish to be protected against. On the other hand, premature death is the harm against which tort law is least able to protect us. Tort law relies on reparation to enforce its obligations, both prospectively and retrospectively. Tort fails prospectively because it does not price, and therefore does not deter, the harm of wrongful death. It fails retrospectively because money damages cannot undo the harm of death. Direct regulation of risk is required to remedy the incompleteness of tort law. This chapter examines the two most relevant regulatory norms—the “safe-level” and “feasibility” standards—against the background of tort law’s limitations.",https://academic.oup.com/book/46533/chapter-abstract/407917386?redirectedFrom=fulltext,2023,Oxford Studies in Private Law Theory: Volume II,,,,,,,10.1093/oso/9780198876076.003.0008,gkeating@law.usc.edu,No

An overlooked problem is that the word ""time"" is potentially ambiguous, referring both to a particular episode and to conventional temporal information. We examined 191 6-9-year-old maltreated children's responses to questions about recent events varying the wording of the invitations, either asking children to ""tell me about"" or ""tell me what happened"" one time/the first time/the last time the child experienced recent recurrent events. Additionally, half of the children were asked a series of ""when"" questions about recurrent events before the invitations. Children were several times more likely to provide exclusively conventional temporal information to ""tell me about"" invitations compared to ""tell me what happened"" invitations, and asking ""when"" questions before the invitations increased children's tendency to give exclusively conventional temporal information. Children who answered a higher proportion of ""when"" questions with conventional temporal information were also more likely to do so in response to the invitations.

This study examined references to sexual body part knowledge and sexual touch in attorneys' questions and 5- to 10-year-old children's responses (N = 2,247) in 113 child sexual abuse trials. Regardless of children's age, attorneys and children primarily used unclear colloquialisms to refer to sexual body parts. Questions asking children to name sexual body parts elicited more uninformative responses than questions about the function of sexual body parts. In turn, questions about the function of sexual body parts were more likely to increase the specificity of body part identifications than questions about the location of sexual body parts. Attorneys predominantly used option-posing (yes-no and forced choice) questions to ask about sexual body part knowledge, the location of touch, the method or manner of touching, skin-to-skin contact, penetration, and how the touching felt.

However, children tend to answer “How” evaluative questions productively (e.g., “How did you feel?”). “How” evaluative questions are phrased as a “How” followed by an auxiliary verb (e.g., “did” or “was”), but so are “How” questions requesting information about method or manner (e.g., “How did he touch you?”), and “How” method/manner questions might be more difficult for children to answer.

Across age, children gave more productive answers to “How” evaluative questions than “How” method/manner questions. Although even young children responded appropriately to “How” method/manner questions over 80% of the time, specific types of “How” method/manner questions were particularly difficult, including questions regarding clothing, body positioning, and the nature of touch.

There are questions about how that uncooperativeness is expressed, whether it is evident in successfully prosecuted cases, and whether it is unique to trafficked minors or it emerges in similar age victims of sexual abuse. To provide insight relevant to these questions, we compared appellate opinions in two types of successfully prosecuted criminal cases: sex trafficking and sexual abuse of adolescent victims. In the trafficking opinions, victims were rarely described as disclosing on their own or as knowing their trafficker before the victimization. The opinions also often alluded to the trafficking victims’ uncooperativeness and delinquency history, and frequently mentioned electronic evidence and prosecution experts. The sexual abuse opinions, in contrast, tended to suggest that victims’ own disclosures initiated the case, perpetrators were known and trusted adults, and caregiver support during the case was common. Finally, the sexual abuse opinions never explicitly mentioned victim uncooperativeness or electronic evidence and rarely mentioned expert testimony or delinquency.

In the context of child maltreatment, a false positive is a false finding of abuse, and a false negative is an erroneous finding that abuse did not occur. For practical purposes, false negatives include cases in which abuse occurred, but for which there is insufficient evidence supporting an abuse finding. In criminal law, one speaks of false convictions and false acquittals. But one can think of the two types of error at every stage of legal intervention. In child abuse reporting, for example, there are false reports and false judgments that reporting is not warranted. Furthermore, the concept of false positives and false negatives can be applied to evidence suggesting that abuse occurred. In this context, a false positive occurs when the evidence appears in the absence of abuse, and a false negative occurs when the evidence is lacking in the presence of abuse. In what follows, I will focus on the difficulties in assessing evidence of abuse, and in particular the difficulties in as- sessing children's behavior that might indicate that abuse occurred.

The estate and gift tax law has been critiqued as ineffective in curbing the growth of dynastic wealth. What goals are well served by the current law of wealth transfer taxation? Who benefits the most from the current tax structure? How might estate and gift tax laws be more effective as a backstop for the income tax? What role do lawyers play in the tax system, and how does that uniquely manifest in the wealth transfer tax context?

Their purpose is to figure out the meaning of a text, and their outcome is to determine the meaning of the text. Both the purpose and the outcome are linguistic.

The rule of lenity is not an ordinary canon of statutory interpretation. The rule of lenity’s outcome is to determine the meaning of a text, giving ambiguous criminal statutes a narrow interpretation, but its purpose is public policy, protecting defendants when ambiguous statutes failed to give fair notice that their actions would be punished. Unlike the ordinary canons of statutory interpretation, lenity encodes into jurisprudence not a linguistic rule, but a policy rule. Thus, a discrepancy arises: lenity’s outcome is linguistic, but its purpose is non-linguistic.

This Article makes the following three contributions. First, it analyzes the nature of the discrepancy between lenity’s purpose and outcome. Second, it demonstrates that this discrepancy leads to doctrinal issues in how the rule of lenity is applied. Sometimes the rule of lenity is over-inclusive: it is applied even when there is no violation of fair notice. Sometimes the rule of lenity is under-inclusive: the rule of lenity fails to protect certain defendants that were misled by ambiguous criminal statutes. Third, this Article argues that we can align lenity’s purpose and outcome by reforming lenity into an excuse in criminal law, and this theoretical reformation will resolve the aforementioned doctrinal issues.","https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/2023/05/27/lenity-and-the-meaning-of-statutes/#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20rule%20of%20lenity%20is%20to%20protect,concerning%20rule%20of%20law%20values.",2023,Southern California Law Review,96,,,397,448,,not found,jnam@law.usc.edu,Yes

They are permissible targets and can kill each other in battle. This basic feature of international law has been recently put into question by a group of moral philosophers known as revisionists, who argue that just combatants in an unjust war should be considered innocents, and their deaths considered murder.

Dr. Prieto Rudolphy explains and assesses the conflict between the revisionist argument and the existing legal norms in The Morality of the Laws of War: War, Law, and Murder. The book provides an in-depth assessment of modern ethical thought on killing in wartime, deconstructing the revisionist view of war and offering a new perspective on the legal equality of combatants.

Prieto Rudolphy not only examines the tension between the revisionist morality and the traditional thesis of symmetry between combatants but proposes a contingent justification of the latter and an alternative morality of war. Underlying both is the inescapable fact that regulating war is always a moral compromise. At the same time, she argues that there is urgent moral pressure to improve our laws - to bring them closer to an ideal whereby war does not exist. The Morality of the Laws of War is a must-read for scholars of moral philosophy and international law, from students to experts, providing a thorough account of contemporary debates on the ethics of warfare and using nuanced arguments to illuminate a fresh perspective.",https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-morality-of-the-laws-of-war-9780192855473,2023,,,,,,,,not found,mprieto@law.usc.edu,No

They consider the borrower’s existing capital structure and how it may evolve in the future. They focus in particular on four aspects of the debtor’s capital stack: What loans are (or might in the future) be secured? What entity or entities have promised to pay (or may promise to pay in the future) which obligations? Which existing debt (and possible future debt) has been (or may be) contractually subordinated to other debt? What are the relative maturity dates of existing (or future) loans? These four aspects provide the lender with an understanding of how likely its debt is to be paid should the debtor encounter financial distress.

The first three questions address familiar forms of priority that translate directly into the bankruptcy forum when a borrower files for Chapter 11. Creditors who have bargained for security enjoy the value of their collateral. Creditors that have loans that are structurally senior to other loans enjoy the assets of the entity that has made the direct promise. Subordination agreements are routinely enforced. The last aspect – temporal priority – is destroyed. Outside of bankruptcy, having a debt that matures earlier gives the creditor significant leverage over the borrower. The case of J. Crew, where the debtor engaged in a dropdown transaction to channel value to unsecured payment-in-kind note holders at the expense of its secured lenders illustrates the effect such leverage can have.

The Mental Health GPS model starts with the traditional peer-run warmline for people who may just want to talk or learn about available, suited resources. It then enhances this basic support with sophisticated human and database resources to provide an independent navigation service delivered by peer support specialists who possess both relevant life experience and clinical knowledge/fluency, and are backed by a vetted list of mental health providers to ensure guidance to apt services. The GPS is not designed to be a crisis hotline for imminent life-and-death circumstances, but instead to help a person navigate the mental health system and effectively avert a crisis. In the 1-year pilot, the Mental Health GPS service received 2,384 calls or texts, almost all generated by Internet searches on smartphones. The themes most often associated with caller concerns were work/personal (41.6%), depression (11.7%), and general anxiety (7.2%).",https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/CAT.23.0231,2023,NEJM Catalyst,4,11,,,,,10.1056/CAT.23.0231,saksinstitute@law.usc.edu,Yes

In the first DBS clinical trial for treatment refractory schizophrenia, despite promising results in treating psychosis, one of the eight subjects experienced both a symptomatic hemorrhage and an infection requiring device removal. Now, ethical concerns about higher surgical risk in schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (SZ/SAD) are impacting clinical trial progress. However, insufficient cases preclude conclusions regarding DBS risk in SZ/SAD. Therefore, we directly compare adverse surgical outcomes for all surgical procedures between SZ/SAD and Parkinson's disease (PD) cases to infer relative surgical risk relevant to gauging DBS risks in subjects with SZ/SAD.

Design: In the primary analysis, we used browser-based statistical analysis software, TriNetX Live (trinetx.com TriNetX LLC, Cambridge, MA), for Measures of Association using the Z-test. Postsurgical morbidity and mortality after matching for ethnicity, over 39 risk factors, and 19 CPT 1003143 coded surgical procedures from over 35,000 electronic medical records, over 19 years, from 48 United States health care organizations (HCOs) through the TriNetX Research Network™. TriNetXis a global, federated, web-based health research network providing access and statistical analysis of aggregate counts of deidentified EMR data. Diagnoses were based on ICD-10 codes. In the final analysis, logistic regression was used to determine relative frequencies of outcomes among 21 diagnostic groups/cohorts being treated with or considered for DBS and 3 control cohorts.

Results: Postsurgical mortality was 1.01-4.11% lower in SZ/SAD compared to the matched PD cohort at 1 month and 1 year after any surgery, while morbidity was 1.91-2.73% higher and associated with postsurgical noncompliance with medical treatment. Hemorrhages and infections were not increased. Across the 21 cohorts compared, PD and SZ/SAD were among eight cohorts with fewer surgeries, nine cohorts with higher postsurgical morbidity, and fifteen cohorts within the control-group range for 1-month postsurgical mortality.

Conclusions: Given that the subjects with SZ or SAD, along with most other diagnostic groups examined, had lower postsurgical mortality than PD subjects, it is reasonable to apply existing ethical and clinical guidelines to identify appropriate surgical candidates for inclusion of these patient populations in DBS clinical trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37066004/,2023,Postsurgical Morbidity and Mortality Favorably Informs Deep Brain Stimulation for New Indications Including Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder,2023,10,,,,,10.3389/fsurg.2023.958452,saksinstitute@law.usc.edu,Yes

Notwithstanding the richness and overall empirical soundness of the bias research, the field can be described as disjointed, incomplete, and undertheorized. In this article, we seek to address this disconnect by offering “coherence-based reasoning” as a parsimonious theoretical framework that explains a sizable number of important deviations from normative forms of reasoning. Represented in connectionist networks and processed through constraint-satisfaction processing, coherence-based reasoning serves as a ubiquitous, essential, and overwhelmingly adaptive apparatus in people’s mental toolbox. This adaptive process, however, can readily be overrun by bias when the network is dominated by nodes or links that are incorrect, overweighted, or otherwise nonnormative. We apply this framework to explain a variety of well-established biased forms of reasoning, including confirmation bias, the halo effect, stereotype spillovers, hindsight bias, motivated reasoning, emotion-driven reasoning, ideological reasoning, and more.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231204579,2023,Perspectives on Psychological Science,45231,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916231204579,dsimon@law.usc.edu,No
,yes,Article,"Tolson, Franita",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,55257523100,The ‘Independent’ State Legislature in Republican Theory.,"The independent state legislature theory provides that state legislatures are not constrained by their respective state constitutions in exercising the authority that the U.S. Constitution delegates to states over federal elections. In its most extreme form, the doctrine permits state legislatures, in overseeing the mechanics of federal elections, to disregard state court interpretations of state constitutions. Scholars have offered a number of criticisms of this doctrine, noting that it runs counter to the founding generation’s concerns about the lawlessness of state legislatures; is contrary to historical practice at the founding; and undermines the constitutional structure in which the more democratically accountable Congress, rather than the states, is vested with final say over federal elections.

This Essay, forthcoming in a special Texas A&M Law Review symposium issue celebrating Professor Richard Epstein, contributes to this growing literature by pointing to the constraints, centered in the constitutional text and history, that limit the ability of legislatures to disregard their state constitutions. Specifically, the Electors Clause of Article II, Section 1 provides that, “Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress…” This text explicitly raises the question of who is the “state” on behalf of which the legislature deploys power?

Using this language as its jumping off point, this Essay argues that the “state” referenced in Article II, Section 1 refers to its citizens, whose preferences are conveyed to the state legislature through the state’s electorate and in the state constitution. Within a decade of the founding, the selection of officials by the state’s electorate became central to the theory of republicanism underlying the Guarantee Clause of Article IV, which predicated the legitimacy of government on majority support. By the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, which changed the structure of presidential elections, political elites viewed republican government as requiring that state legislatures and, to a lesser extent, federal officials, be accountable to the people who elected them, accountability that prevented state legislatures from exercising their authority over federal elections in blatant disregard of the people’s wishes.

The Essay concludes that the independent state legislature theory, particularly in its strongest iteration, runs counter to the democratizing effect that the Twelfth Amendment was intended to have on presidential elections. The theory allows the state legislature to disregard the preferences of the people at a juncture in which they are exercising the oversight and accountability at the core of our system of republicanism: during the election of federal officials. Any version of the doctrine, if adopted, has to respect majoritarian preferences.

It shows how the substance of constitutional law sometimes induces the creation of political parties around the opportunities presented by (and omitted from) constitutional language, and how constitutional structures similarly induce the forms party systems take. The analysis also shows how these interconnected features are themselves connected to competing ideologies that attempt to describe and direct political development. And it demonstrates how a historical perspective on a constitution can provide normative insights into contemporary controversies. Similar arguments might well be available where constitutions encourage the development of multiparty systems or where social democracy is a more important ideology than republicanism.",https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollchap/book/9781839101649/book-part-9781839101649-26.xml,2023,Research Handbook on the Politics of Constitutional Law,,,,310,328,,https://doi.org/10.4337/9781839101649.00026,dean@law.usc.edu,No

However, oversight of any agency is dispersed among several committees across the House and Senate. How does this decentralization affect the strategic incentives for oversight by each committee? And how do the strategic incentives of oversight committees align with the collective interest of Congress as a whole? We develop a formal, spatial model of decentralized oversight to investigate these questions. The model shows that when committees have similar interests in affecting agency policy, committees attempt to free ride on each other, and oversight levels are inefficiently low. But if committees have competing interests in affecting agency policy, they engage in “dueling oversight” with little overall effect, and oversight levels are inefficiently high. Overall, we contend that committee oversight incentives do not generally align with the collective interests of Congress, and the problem cannot be easily solved by structural changes within a single chamber.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09516298231202428?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.5,2023,Journal of Theoretical Politics,35,4,,292,309,,https://doi.org/10.1177/09516298231202428,awood@law.usc.edu,Yes

As MDL has become a major site for aggregate litigation, commentators have raised concerns that large-scale products liability cases are unduly influenced by a small cadre of elite lawyers whom courts repeatedly appointed to serve in the most powerful MDL leadership roles. Repeated appointments of these ""repeat players,"" commentators worry, facilitate self-dealing, suppress dissent, and aggravate conflicts of interest seen in other areas of aggregate litigation. These concerns about MDL overlap with broader concerns across the bench and bar about the degree to which white people and men dominate important leadership posts, to the exclusion of younger attorneys, women, LGBTQ+ people, and attorneys of color.

In response to these concerns, prominent authorities urged MDL courts to adopt a number of reforms. They recommended that judges appoint leaders through open, competitive processes; create additional leadership posts and committees; and appoint leaders for limited terms in order to create more opportunities for new attorneys to participate in leadership. But, outside of a handful of highly publicized cases, we have little empirical evidence of whether MDL leadership appointments changed in the ways that reformers proposed. This Article—part of a larger, ongoing study of the nature and functions of MDL leaders and the MDL model of aggregate litigation—begins to fill that gap. Drawing on a dataset of thousands of filings and orders that were entered in sixty-eight products liability MDLs pending in June 2019, we report data on the size, composition, and appointment process for MDL leadership slates, and changes in the makeup of leadership slates in the eighteen-year period our dataset covers.

Our data tentatively suggest that reformers' calls for larger, complex leadership slates and frequent competitive leadership appointment processes went unheeded. Examining trends in the size and structure of MDL leadership slates in products liability MDLs, we find little evidence that courts implemented the structural changes that the reformers suggested. Yet, while leadership appointment practices and the complexity of MDL leadership slates do not appear to have changed during the period we studied, we find intriguing changes in who is being appointed to leadership posts. Slightly less than a quarter of leadership appointments in our data went to female attorneys, suggestive of only a trivial increase in women's representation on leadership slates compared to earlier studies. But the majority of leadership appointments also did not go to super-elite repeat player attorneys. And, comparing our findings with earlier work that examined MDLs pending in 2013, we find substantial movement in the attorneys and firms whom MDL courts appointed most frequently to leadership posts.

These findings complicate received wisdom about MDL leadership posts. While we document considerable continuity in who is being appointed to MDL leadership posts and how, our data are suggestive of a deep bench of potential future MDL leaders for judges to choose from, as well as the opportunity for even further change in the future.",https://texaslawreview.org/diversity-and-complexity-in-mdl-leadership-a-status-report-from-case-management-orders/,2023,Texas Law Review,101,7,,1679,1744,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=4464021,azimmerman@law.usc.edu,Yes
