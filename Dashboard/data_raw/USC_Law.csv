Anca Gheaus and James Dwyer argue that children should be reared by the best available parent, who, in turn, should make choices based only on children’s welfare. They claim that love and respect require this fiduciary stance. However, love and respect do not justify child-centered norms. If children were competent, they would embrace norms that accommodate parental interests because they benefit from nonfiduciary rules, are grateful to their parents, and reject discrimination produced by child-centered principles. Furthermore, child-centered accounts imply unreasonably broad obligations to children.",,

These tactics unjustly harm targets when they aim to impede living authentically, deterring them from declaring their beliefs in public or pursuing important projects. They are corrupt because they make their targets willing participants in these harms. They subvert their targets’ ambitions not to allow money or social pressure to influence their most important actions. Although individuals must maintain their integrity, people also have a moral responsibility not to undermine those efforts. Not all uses of these tactics conflict with an anti-corruption norm. Many labour and consumer boycotts likely do not threaten authenticity. Other uses arguably pursue non-corrupt aims, such as punishment, norm reinforcement or non-complicity, threatening corruption only as an unintended consequence. Even as to these, several considerations weigh against using boycotts, shunning, and shaming. Using these techniques for punishment and norm reinforcement is often inappropriate in a liberal society. Some uses that appear to aim at non-complicity also aim at corrupting their targets. Finally, sometimes imposing a risk of unintended corruption wrongs those exposed to such risks.",,

It therefore argues for great circumspection in regulations of hate speech that may be used to limit socially oppressed groups’ access to the words and symbols they view as most forceful and effective in political communication. Although many thoughtful racial-justice advocates support hate speech codes in the interest of racial equality, the Author worries that such regulation can actually hinder the fight for racial equality by being turned against members of marginalized groups who seek to deploy disruptive language in their discourse of resistance and struggle for equality. To explore these issues, the Article discusses current social contests over the meaning of the Confederate Flag and the N-word, two forms of symbolic communication often associated with hateful thoughts and deeds. It examines whether their hateful histories are baked into the meaning of each, so that any use of either constitutes hate speech, or if their meanings are mutable and contestable. The Article links these questions to ones about the mutability and contestability of the words that make up the legal lexicon, many of which have also been associated with rank racial discrimination. Drawing on Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, and George Lakoff, it outlines a social theory of meaning that affirms the radical agency of the legal lexicon—and indeed of all language—and counsels against blanket prohibitions on disruptive or transgressive forms of symbolic communication. It argues that the language of lawyers and laypersons alike lack fixed and frozen meanings and, therefore, even the vilest forms of symbolic communication can be put to novel, or even revolutionary, legal, political, and artistic uses",,

This patent-skeptical climate was best illustrated by antitrust enforcement actions resulting in the compulsory licensing of leading US firms’ patent portfolios. Concurrently, the federal government instituted an implicit compulsory licensing regime through a dramatic infusion of R&D funding into the private sector, accompanied by constraints on firms’ legal exclusivity over technology developed using those funds. The US economy exhibited robust innovation activity for part of this period, followed by a slowdown commencing in the mid-1960s. During this period, R&D funding flowed mostly to large firms, market concentration remained high, and firms targeted by compulsory licensing generally maintained market leadership. The postwar regime of weak patents and public subsidies favored larger firms that could capture returns on innovation through vertically integrated structures and access to government funding. Case studies of two firms targeted by compulsory licensing suggest that this regime may have distorted organizational structures and the mix of innovation projects that were undertaken.",,

Based on this view, federal and state legislators have taken, and continue to consider, actions to limit the enforcement of covenants not to compete in employment agreements. These actions would discard the centuries-old reasonableness standard that governs the enforcement of these provisions, often termed ""noncompetes,"" in all but four states (notably, California). We argue that this zero-enforcement position lacks a sound basis in theory or empirics. As a matter of theory, it overlooks the complex effects of contractual limitations on labor mobility in innovation markets. While it is frequently asserted that noncompetes may impede knowledge spillovers that foster innovation, it is frequently overlooked that noncompetes may encourage firms to invest in cultivating intellectual and human capital. As a matter of empirics, we show that two commonly referenced bodies of evidence fail to support zero enforcement. First, we revisit the conventional account of the rise of Silicon Valley and the purported fall of the Boston area as innovation centers, showing that this divergence cannot suitably be explained by differences in state law regarding noncompetes. Second, we show that widely cited empirical studies fail to support a causal relationship between noncompetes, reduced labor mobility, and reduced innovation. Given these theoretical and empirical complexities, we propose an error-cost approach that provides an economic rationale for the common law's reasonableness approach toward contractual constraints on the circulation of human capital.",,

In licensing markets for standard-essential patents (SEPs), it has been periodically proposed that this rule should be relaxed to permit licensing negotiation groups (LNGs), which is expected to reduce transaction costs and the purportedly ‘excessive’ royalties paid to licensors. Based on the economic structure and historical performance of wireless technology markets, this policy intervention is likely to degrade, rather than enhance, competitive conditions in the wireless, automotive, and other markets encompassed by the ‘Internet of Things’. In the short term, LNGs would most likely result in a redistributive (not an efficiency) effect that shifts value from innovators to implementers in the technology supply chain without necessarily passing on cost-savings to consumers. In the medium to longer term, LNGs are liable to impose efficiency losses by endangering the viability of licensing-based monetization models that have funded research and development, promoted dissemination of technology inputs, facilitated entry in device production, and enabled business models across multiple industries. While LNGs may reduce the transaction costs of SEP licensing, the historical record shows that pooling structures can achieve the same objective at a substantially lower risk of competitive harm.",,

Based on this view, the Supreme Court, Congress, and federal antitrust regulators have taken a series of steps, approximately since the mid-2000s, that have significantly weakened patent protections and, for substantial categories of patent owners, largely precluded the possibility of securing injunctive relief against infringers. An accumulating and under-acknowledged body of empirical research now indicates that this common understanding concerning the alleged failures of the U.S. patent system often relies on theoretical intuitions and anecdotal reports that ultimately lack compelling evidentiary support. Roughly concurrently, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office and, to a lesser but still material extent, the U.S. Supreme Court have taken actions or issued statements that have incrementally enhanced certain protections for patent owners. Courts in the United Kingdom and the European Union have also taken steps to bolster the availability of injunctive relief for certain types of patent owners.

They envision a legal utopia in which every fact pattern is assigned society’s preferred legal treatment in real time. But regulation is a dynamic process; regulated parties react to law. They change their behavior to pursue their preferred outcomes— which often diverge from society’s—and they will continue to do so under personalized law: They will provide regulators with incomplete or inaccurate information. They will attempt to manipulate the algorithms underlying personalized laws by taking actions intended to disguise their true characteristics. Personalized law can also (unintentionally) encourage regulated parties to act in socially undesirable ways, a phenomenon known as moral hazard. Moreover, regulators seeking to combat these dynamics will face significant constraints. Regulators will have imperfect information, both because of privacy concerns and because regulated parties and intermediaries will muddle regulators’ data. They may lack the authority or the political will to respond to regulated parties’ behavior. The transparency requirements of a democratic society may hinder their ability to thwart gamesmanship. Concerns about unintended consequences may further lower regulators’ willingness to personalize law. Taken together, these dynamics will limit personalized law’s ability to optimally match facts to legal outcomes.

This was only possible because police misconduct records in Minnesota are publicly accessible, unlike in most of America, where we rely on leaks for such information.

Several doctrinal components lead to this confluence: First, the moribund “intelligible principle” test has evolved to provide little or no constraint on this or any other delegation. Second, a delegation to the President, specifically, is not subject to the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), leaving no extrinsic, enforceable obligation to avoid arbitrary action. Third, the Supreme Court has barred from review the correctness of any factual finding by the President that provides the statutory trigger for his own power. Finally, a new presidential attitude has ushered in a collapse of the voluntary or informal norms of self-restraint that once offered some modicum of constraint on presidential power. Developments in the Court’s separation-of-powers jurisprudence over decades have opened up a dangerous lacuna in the overall constitutional protection against arbitrary government action, ready to be exploited by any President who might show an inclination to read his or her power as unlimited and unchecked, undeterred by the norms of historical practice. When a President walks upon the stage thus set by prior doctrine, the combination creates a perfect storm for a threat to individual liberty. The following discussion will first examine each element of the problem in the case law as fleshed out by earlier scholars, and then examine the ramifications for the protection of rights today in the center of the storm. I will conclude by suggesting that the nondelegation doctrine should indeed be revived, but specifically for the purpose of limiting, constraining, and reviewing the actions of a President pursuant to direct delegated authority.",,

Second, the Statement establishes the permanent cessation of circulation to the brain as the standard to determine death by circulatory criteria. Death may be declared after an elapsed observation period of 5 min without circulation to the brain, which confirms that the absence of circulation to the brain is permanent. Finally, the Statement highlights the value of perfusion repair for increasing the success of cDCDD organ transplantation. cDCDD protocols may utilize either in situ or ex situ perfusion consistent with the practice of each country.

Vouchers for future transplant provide a means of overcoming the chronological incompatibility that occurs when the ideal time for living donation differs from the time at which the intended recipient actually needs a transplant. However, uncertainty remains regarding the actual change in the number of living kidney donors associated with voucher programs and the capability of voucher redemptions to produce timely transplants. OBJECTIVE: To examine the consequences of voucher-based kidney donation and the capability of voucher redemptions to provide timely kidney allografts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study of 79 transplant centers across the US used data from the National Kidney Registry from January 1, 2014, to January 31, 2021, to identify all family vouchers and patterns in downstream kidney-paired donations. The analysis included living kidney donors and recipients participating in the National Kidney Registry family voucher program. EXPOSURES: A voucher was provided to the intended recipient at the time of donation. Vouchers had no cash value and could not be sold, bartered, or transferred to another person. When a voucher was redeemed, a living donation chain was used to return a kidney to the voucher holder. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Deidentified demographic and clinical data from each kidney donation were evaluated, including the downstream patterns in kidney-paired donation. Voucher redemptions were separately evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2021, 250 family voucher-based donations were facilitated. Each donation precipitated a transplant chain with a mean (SD) length of 2.3 (1.6) downstream kidney transplants, facilitating 573 total transplants. Of those, 111 transplants (19.4%) were performed in highly sensitized recipients. Among 250 voucher donors, the median age was 46 years (range, 19-78 years), and 157 donors (62.8%) were female, 241 (96.4%) were White, and 104 (41.6%) had blood type O. Over a 7-year period, the waiting time for those in the National Kidney Registry exchange pool decreased by more than 3 months. Six vouchers were redeemed, and 3 of those redemptions were among individuals with blood type O. The time from voucher redemption to kidney transplant ranged from 36 to 155 days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the family voucher program appeared to mitigate a major disincentive to living kidney donation, namely the reluctance to donate a kidney in the present that could be redeemed in the future if needed. The program facilitated kidney donations that may not otherwise have occurred. All 6 of the redeemed vouchers produced timely kidney transplants, indicating the capability of the voucher program.",,

A community-engaged research project proposed a resilience assessment that would use panarchy theory to move the city toward a more sustainable food system. Flint is one of many examples that demonstrates how panarchy theory is being applied to understand and influence change in complex human-natural systems. Applied Panarchy, the much-anticipated successor to Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling’s seminal 2002 volume Panarchy, documents the extraordinary advances in interdisciplinary panarchy scholarship and applications over the past two decades. Panarchy theory has been applied to a broad range of fields, from economics to law to urban planning, changing the practice of environmental stewardship for the better in measurable, tangible ways. Panarchy describes the way systems—whether forests, electrical grids, agriculture, coastal surges, public health, or human economies and governance—are part of even larger systems that interact in unpredictable ways. Although humans desire resiliency and stability in our lives to help us understand the world and survive, nothing in nature is permanently stable. How can society anticipate and adjust to the changes we see around us? Where Panarchy proposed a framework to understand how these transformational cycles work and how we might influence them, Applied Panarchy takes the scholarship to the next level, demonstrating how these concepts have been modified and refined. The book shows how panarchy theory intersects with other disciplines, and how it directly influences natural resources management and environmental stewardship. Intended as a text for graduate courses in environmental sciences and related fields, Applied Panarchy picks up where Panarchy left off, inspiring new generations of scholars, researchers, and professionals to put its ideas to work in practical ways.",,

This book, the fourth in a series by the Environmental Law Collaborative, addresses disruption from a variety of influences and perspectives. Some essays consider the disruptive effects of environmental changes on human and ecological safety, security, and well-being, suggesting that the impacts of climate changes are not accounted for in the current legal system. Some identify key changes needed to respond to climatic challenges, social inequities, and dwindling grey and green resources. Others deconstruct social, political, and professional frameworks to understand how such influences might be used to disrupt the current regime, or even ones where expectations are being disrupted with the endorsement of law.

The intentional result of federal and state vaccination policies was that fewer people got these diseases. The perverse result was that perceptions of disease risk shifted, making the vaccines themselves seem like the far riskier option to many people, generating pressure to eliminate or mitigate vaccination mandates.

Formal government and legal structures further constrain the adaptive capacity of our SETs. However, new, self-organized forms of adaptive governance are emerging at multiple scales in natural resource-based SETs. Adaptive governance involves the private and public sectors as well as formal and informal institutions, self-organized to fill governance gaps in the traditional roles of states. While new governance forms are emerging, they are not yet doing so rapidly enough to match the pace of environmental change. Furthermore, they do not yet possess the legitimacy or capacity needed to address disparities between the winners and losers from change. These emergent forms of adaptive governance appear to be particularly effective in managing complexity. We explore governance and SETs as coevolving complex systems, focusing on legal systems to understand the potential pathways and obstacles to equitable adaptation. We explore how governments may facilitate the emergence of adaptive governance and promote legitimacy in both the process of governance despite the involvement of nonstate actors, and its adherence to democratic values of equity and justice. To manage the contextual nature of the results of change in complex systems, we propose the establishment of long-term study initiatives for the coproduction of knowledge, to accelerate learning and synergize interactions between science and governance and to foster public science and epistemic communities dedicated to navigating transitions to more just, sustainable, and resilient futures.",,

We show that the literature is bifurcated: studies focusing on the social identity of individual judges (such as their gender, race, and nationality) generate findings consistent with in-group bias, whereas research on the social diversity of judges sitting in panels suggests that benefits can accrue from socially diverse courts.

Aware that further absences also haunt US history, he invites successors to catalog them to produce yet-truer histories of the US. This review takes up the invitation. It sketches out a legal history of race and borders in the US in which indigeneity, race, slavery, and immigration join empire on center stage. Like Immerwahr's, this history is of shameful and self-obscuring events. Unlike Immerwahr's, it centers on the ways that law accomplished and hid the wrongs done. The crucial mechanism is ""status manipulation,"" a term in deliberate tension with itself. Status presents as a fixed, enduring legal classification that relates people and places to polities. By contrast, manipulation involves purposeful change. Hence, as used here, ""status manipulation"" combines apparent continuity and actual change as it achieves subordination from the shadows.

We identified 3 major themes of pervasive issues—Detainee Not Patient, System Over Patient, and Grossly Substandard Care— and 11 subthemes. Subthemes of culture of shortcuts, delays in care, and poor care delivered were present in the vast majority of cases. Subthemes bias and discrimination, language injustice, falsification of and inconsistencies between records and reports, willful indifference, security over health, communication breakdown, inadequate resources, failure of protective mechanisms, missing/ignoring red flags, and failure of emergency response were also prominent.",,

In approaching the production of archives in a new way, Smallwood explores the possibility of “counterhistories” that could be accountable to the enslaved, doing the work in the present of remembering the past. She questions what it means to read the archive “against the grain,” forswearing the metanarrative of a historical search for truth.2 She gives the example of her own work in Saltwater Slavery, reading the marginalia in the numerical ledgers of the slave trade as literary text, to give “interpretive weight to the captives’ experience of ‘a journey in which some-one died fifty-one times.’”3",,

Nonetheless, many barriers remain to be addressed for all people who need it to be able to benefit from this new approach. Decades of experience have shown the need to address human rights and gender dynamics in the rollout of any new HIV-related biomedical innovation. The success of U=U/TasP is contingent on an array of factors beyond individual control including protective legal environments, access to acceptable and quality health services including an uninterrupted supply of antiretroviral drugs and regular viral load testing without discrimination, and supportive social and community environments. This chapter seeks to understand how global organisations, non-governmental organisations and advocacy groups address U=U/TasP, in particular the extent to which they focus on gender and rights in their published materials, and ultimately the extent to which this makes a difference for people’s lives.",,

Wide variation exists in frameworks and measures used. Methods Building on the existing knowledge syntheses, we carried out a systematic review to identify frameworks and measures aiming to understand or assess internalized stigma, stigma and discrimination in healthcare, and in law and policy. The review addressed two questions: Which conceptual frameworks have been proposed to assess internalized stigma, stigma and discrimination experienced in healthcare settings, and stigma and discrimination entrenched in national laws and policies? Which measures of these different types of stigma and discrimination have been proposed and what are their descriptive properties? Searches, completed on 6 May 2021, cover publications from 2008 onwards. The review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021249348), the protocol incorporated stakeholder input, and the data are available in the Systematic Review Data Repository. Results and discussion Sixty-nine frameworks and 50 measures met the inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal figures and detailed evidence tables summarize these resources. We established a compendium of frameworks and a catalogue of measures of HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Seventeen frameworks and 10 measures addressed at least two of our focus domains, with least attention to stigma and discrimination in law and policy. The lack of common definitions and variability in scope and structure of HIV-related frameworks and measures creates challenges in understanding what is being addressed and measured, both in relation to stigma and efforts to mitigate or reduce its harmful effects. Having comparable data is essential for tracking change over time within and between interventions. Conclusions This systematic review provides an evidence base of current understandings of HIV-related stigma and discrimination and how further conceptual clarification and increased adaptation of existing tools might help overcome challenges across the HIV care continuum. With people living with HIV at the centre, experts from different stakeholder groups could usefully collaborate to guide a more streamlined approach for the field. This can help to achieve global targets and understand, measure and help mitigate the impact of different types of HIV-related stigma on people's health and quality of life.",,

A diagnostic assay that could rapidly identify acutely infected individuals who are not yet antibody positive could transform our response to the epidemic, particularly in high burden countries and communities. At an individual level, a positive recency test result would need to be confirmed with a more definitive assay, and that could lead to the individual being immediately offered to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Diagnosing individuals who have recently acquired HIV, initiating them on treatment and achieving viral transmission, reduces the likelihood of onward transmission at a time when viral load is highest, but routinely used antibody assays are unlikely to find them. The identification of new or unknown HIV infections through recency testing together with geo-spatial mapping, could enable prioritization of HIV prevention and treatment efforts to communities with increasing new transmissions. Information on those who have been recently infected or with unknown HIV status could be especially helpful for achieving the first two ‘90’s of the UNAIDS 2020 ‘90-90-90’ strategy: prioritization of HIV testing and linkage to care in addition to the public health benefits of reducing HIV transmission.",,

Over and above simply the availability of vaccine a multitude of factors have been identified as contributing to gaps in vaccination rates, ranging from individual hesitancy, to community distrust, to inadequate national health systems, let alone global-level supply chain issues and restrictive intellectual property regimes. While not unique to COVID-19, many of these have proven even more nefarious in the context of access to COVID-19 vaccine, with implications for global health more broadly.

Efficiency requires that startups sell their technology to the right incumbents, that they develop the right technology, and that they invest the right amount in R&D. In a model of differentiated oligopoly, we show distortions along all three margins if there are no limits on startup acquisition. Leading incumbents make acquisitions partially to keep lagging incumbents from catching up technologically. When startups can choose what kind of technology they invent, they are biased toward inventions that improve the leader’s technology rather than those that help the laggard incumbent catch up. Further, upon obtaining a pure monopoly, the leading incumbent’s marginal willingness to pay for new technologies falls abruptly, which diminishes private returns on future innovations. We consider antitrust measures that could mitigate these problems.",,

Many researchers and practitioners worry about harms to competition or innovation. However, there has been very little antitrust enforcement in this area. This is emblematic of a prominent feature of modern antitrust law: a strong preference for erring on the side of nonenforcement. A leading rationale for this preference is the claim that market power self-corrects by attracting new entrants who discipline incumbents. As a result, plaintiffs generally face very demanding evidentiary requirements, which are particularly hard to satisfy in the case of startup acquisitions. A typical startup is both new and small, providing little data for estimating competitive effects. Despite this uncertainty, it is unlikely that society is best served by a policy of near-universal inaction. Recent work in economics, both empirical and theoretical, identifies various harms to competition and innovation as a result of startup acquisitions in concentrated markets. Further, the traditional error cost argument is particularly inapposite in this context, as startup acquisitions may be undertaken precisely because they forestall competitive entry. We therefore argue for expanded antitrust intervention (that is, more than zero) in startup acquisitions by dominant incumbents. In practice, the acquirer's market power and the transaction value may be useful signals of the risk of harm.",,

The history of the Grand Old Party (GOP) in the South during Reconstruction is fairly well known, as is its reemergence in the region during the Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon presidential campaigns in 1964 and 1968. What is not well known, however, is the period in between: what did the GOP in the South look like between the end of Reconstruction and before the modern 'Southern strategy'? A common assumption is that the Republican Party in the South all but disappeared after the demise of Reconstruction, and that it only reemerged when the national Democratic Party went ""all in"" on civil rights in the mid-1960s while the national Republican Party (led by Goldwater) largely rejected civil rights.1 Certainly, the Southern GOP achieved little electoral success in the region in this period.

We look for evidence of such ‘partisan retrospection’ by examining the effects of Hurricane Sandy on the 2012 presidential election, and find that voters’ reactions to disaster damage were strongly conditioned by pre-existing partisanship, with counties that previously supported Obama reacting far more positively to disaster damage than those that had earlier opposed him. We then use existing data to investigate the relationship between disasters and presidential elections between 1972 and 2004.

To fill this void, we present original data that track the racial composition of Republican National Convention delegations from the South between 1868 and 1952.

Allan makes several insightful observations about law and legal practice. As Allan correctly notes, (i) the moral evaluation of legal rules and institutions is carried out within legal practice and its traditions, and therefore the view that we can come up with practice-independent moral principles to evaluate the law is at least dubious; (ii) legislative enactments require judicial interpretation to determine their meaning and their incorporation within a democratic legal system; and (iii) law fulfils its functions, and allows for impartial resolution of disputes, by establishing public standards of justice that displace private judgments about political morality. In this reply, I suggest that—in contrast to what non-positivists like Allan would argue—each of these observations is either compatible with, or reinforces, a positivist view of law and legal institutions. Arguably, non-positivist views still have an advantage over positivism: they seem to fit easily with most citizens’ and officials’ judgments about legal obligation.

This chapter discusses existing theoretical and empirical work, and identifies research gaps as well as avenues for new scholarship on how firms or competition authorities might invest in AI compliance to improve detection of wrongdoing. We suggest where AI collusion is possible and offer new twists to where prior work has not identified possible collusion. Specifically, we identify the importance of AI in addressing the “trust” issue in collusion. We also identify that AI collusion is possible across nonprice dimensions, such as manipulated product reviews and ratings, and discuss potential screens involving co-movements of prices and ratings.

Since the rise of legal realism, discussions of deterrence, compensation, the minimization of accident costs, and the distribution of losses have dominated scholarly discourse. In the past several decades, however, wholesale rejections of instrumentalist tort theory have arisen. The most uncompromising of these views rallies around the avowedly formalist battle cry that tort is “private law”. Ernest Weinrib’s elegant and influential book, The Idea of Private Law , declares its allegiance to that thesis in its title, and the idea figures almost as centrally in Arthur Ripstein’s recent and important Private Wrongs . Theorists who rally around the banner of “private law” claim that tort law’s governing principles of right and responsibility tumble out of the field’s characteristic legal form. Law, as they understand it, is constitutive of just relations among persons, not an instrument for the pursuit of independently valuable ends. For scholars like Weinrib and Ripstein, “private law” is the Kantian idea of reason that makes our actual law of torts intelligible. The claim that torts is a law of wrongs where persons bring claims in their own names for harms that they have wrongly suffered against those allegedly responsible for those wrongful harms is powerful and persuasive. The claim that the obligations persons owe one another in tort are obligations owed among equal and independent persons is likewise compelling. But theorists of tort as “private law” overshoot the mark by both asking and making too much of form. They ask too much of form when they attempt to make sense of the private law of torts solely in terms of form—eschewing all talk of interests. We cannot understand or justify the law of torts without attending to the interests that it protects. In tort, as elsewhere, rights and the duties they ground protect important individual interests. For example, it is our interest in the physical integrity of our persons that grounds the law of negligence. Theorist of tort as “private law” make too much of form when they present the legal category as its own private fiefdom walled off from surrounding legal fields. For Ripstein and Weinrib, “private law” is its own autonomous domain, sealed off against infection by any legal field whose form identifies it as “public law”. In our law, the private law of torts cooperates and competes with public law institutions as a response to the pervasiveness of accidental harm in an industrial and technological society. It is one way of institutionalizing our interest in safety. Establishing rightful relations among free and equal persons in civil society requires that institutions protect persons’ urgent interests, not just establish their formal independence. The theoretical understanding that we need will recognize that we misunderstand even the private law of torts itself if we sever it entirely from forms of collective responsibility for avoiding and repairing accidental harm with which it competes and cooperates.",,

Fairness comes to the fore because risk impositions require us to compare what those who impose the risks stand to gain with what those upon whom they are imposed stand to lose. Determinations of due care reconcile competing claims of liberty and security, for a plurality of persons. Fairly reconciling liberty and security requires reconciling them on terms that are justifiable both to those who impose risks and to those upon whom they are imposed. This, in turn, requires comparing the benefits and burdens of risk impositions in terms of their objective urgency, assessing the burdens and benefits of risk impositions qualitatively, and assigning a certain priority to the avoidance of harm. The framework is used to explicate the concept of due care articulated by the Hand Formula, to illuminate the circumstance where risks are imposed with a “community of risk”, and to situate subordinate doctrines of due care such as custom, statutory negligence, and jury adjudication. Brief contrasts are drawn with both law and economic approaches to justified precaution as efficient precaution, and with versions of corrective justice which see negligence liability falling out of a universe of conceptual possibilities where it holds the high ground of a golden mean.",,

Firms that sell more products or services were thought more likely to be trustworthy than those that sell less because they have more to lose if consumers decide they have behaved badly. That assumption has been called into question by recent work that shows that, under the standard infinitely repeated game model of reputation, reputational economies of scale will occur only under special conditions, such as monopoly, because larger firms not only have more to lose from behaving badly, but also more to gain. This article argues that reputational economies of scale exist even when there is competition and without other special conditions, if the probability of detection is positively correlated with the frequency of repeat play.

Before the 1990s, artworks were sold with hardly any concern about whether they had been stolen or looted, whereas now any reputable gallery or auction house checks the “provenance” of any substantial work before sale. This transformation reflects interlocking changes in law, norms, and institutions. New York’s and more broadly the United States’ assertion of jurisdiction and application of U.S. substantive law has destabilized title to stolen and looted goods worldwide because American statutes of limitations generally provide weaker protection for those who possess stolen or looted goods even in good faith. Application of American law has had a profound effect, especially for the high end of the market, because European or Asian investors who purchase art outside of the U.S. may eventually want to sell or display their works in the U.S. Defective title under American law thus affects prices worldwide. The tightening and broader application of American law reflects both longstanding legal principles and changes in social norms towards the redress of historical wrongs, most notably prominent campaigns relating to art confiscated or sold under duress in Nazi Germany. New institutions, most importantly searchable databases recording stolen and looted art such as the Art Loss Register, are also changing perceptions about minimum standards for good faith purchase, which in turn affects both social norms and court cases. These new norms, induced by both legal changes and better information, have influenced the market even for less valuable art, for which sale or display in the U.S. is not a relevant consideration and for which the threat of costly legal action is not credible. The fact that social and institutionalized norms play an important role in protecting original owners is probably good, because norms and institutions can be effective even where law is not and often do so at lower cost.",,

Earlier BAMs had no hidden neurons and did not use supervised learning. They tuned their synaptic weights with unsupervised Hebbian or competitive learning. Two-layer feedback BAMs always converge to fixed-point equilibria for threshold or threshold-like neurons. Every rectangular connection matrix is bidirectionally stable. These simpler BAMs extend to arbitrary hidden layers with supervised learning if the resulting bidirectional backpropagation algorithm uses the proper layer likelihood in the forward and backward directions. Bidirectional backpropagation lets users run deep classifiers and regressors in reverse as well as forward. Bidirectional training exploits pattern and synaptic information that forward-only running ignores.,,

We then apply the recent result that carefully chosen noise can speed the average convergence of the EM algorithm as it climbs a hill of probability or log-likelihood. Then injecting such noise can speed the average convergence of the backpropagation algorithm for both the training and pretraining of multilayer neural networks. The beneficial noise adds to the hidden and visible neurons and related parameters. The noise also applies to regularized regression networks. This beneficial noise is just that noise that makes the current signal more probable. We show that such noise also tends to improve classification accuracy. The geometry of the noise-benefit region depends on the probability structure of the neurons in a given layer. The noise-benefit region in noise space lies above the noisy-EM (NEM) hyperplane for classification and involves a hypersphere for regression. Simulations demonstrate these noise benefits using MNIST digit classification. The NEM noise benefits substantially exceed those of simply adding blind noise to the neural network. We further prove that the noise speed-up applies to the deep bidirectional pretraining of neural-network bidirectional associative memories (BAMs) or their functionally equivalent restricted Boltzmann machines. We then show that learning with basic contrastive divergence also reduces to generalized EM for an energy-based network probability. The optimal noise adds to the input visible neurons of a BAM in stacked layers of trained BAMs. Global stability of generalized BAMs guarantees rapid convergence in pretraining where neural signals feed back between contiguous layers. Bipolar coding of inputs further improves pretraining performance.,,

FCMs are fuzzy signed directed graphs that allow degrees of causal influence and event occurrence. Such causal models can simulate a wide range of policy scenarios and decision processes. Their directed loops or cycles directly model causal feedback. Their nonlinear dynamics permit forward-chaining inference from input causes and policy options to output effects. Users can add detailed dynamics and feedback links directly to the causal model or infer them with statistical learning laws. Users can fuse or combine FCMs from multiple experts by weighting and adding the underlying fuzzy edge matrices and do so recursively if needed. The combined FCM tends to better represent domain knowledge as the expert sample size increases if the expert sample approximates a random sample. Many causal models use more restrictive directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian probabilities. DAGs do not model causal feedback because they do not contain closed loops. Combining DAGs also tends to produce cycles and thus tends not to produce a new DAG. Combining DAGs tends to produce a FCM. FCM causal influence is also transitive whereas probabilistic causal influence is not transitive in general. Overall: FCMs trade the numerical precision of probabilistic DAGs for pattern prediction, faster and scalable computation, ease of combination, and richer feedback representation. We show how FCMs can apply to problems of public support for insurgency and terrorism and to US-China conflict relations in Graham Allison's Thucydides-trap framework. The appendix gives the textual justification of the Thucydides-trap FCM.

Therefore, this Essay proposes a way forward that works within the wealth-maximization framework and yet could result in dramatic social change. The idea is simple: Use private debt markets to provide incentives for public-interested corporate action. Specifically, individuals who value prosocial corporate decisions could finance them by contributing to corporate social responsibility (CSR) bonds that would offset the corporation’s implementation costs. To provide an incentive to depart from wealth maximization, the bond would stipulate that the contribution would be forgiven when the decision is implemented by the corporation—a key difference from existing prosocial financial instruments. More broadly, the insight that the individuals with the strongest interest in seeing corporations act responsibly are not always the company’s shareholders has consequences for corporate law and corporate governance. In particular, it cautions that we should recognize the limits of shareholder activism to achieve socially optimal levels of corporate responsibility. The more difficult questions are whether and how to reorient our corporate law system away from shareholders and toward other constituencies.

Our original account of this “corporate governance machine” generates insights about the past, present, and future of corporate governance. As for the past, we show how the concept of corporate governance developed alongside the shareholder primacy movement. This relationship is reflected in the common refrain of “good governance” that pervades contemporary discourse and the maturation of corporate governance as an industry oriented toward serving shareholders and their interests. As for the present, our analysis explains why the corporate social responsibility movement transformed into shareholder value–oriented environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, stakeholder capitalism became relegated to a new separate form of entity known as the benefit corporation, and public company boards of directors became homogenized across industries. As for the future, our analysis suggests that absent a major paradigm shift that would force multiple institutional gatekeepers to switch their orientation, advocacy pushing corporations to consider the interests of employees, communities, and the environment will likely fail unless such effort is framed as advancing shareholder interests.",,

We begin by reviewing the basic forms of shareholder litigation and the benefits such claims might offer mutual fund investors. We then investigate, through an in-depth docket review, whether and how the ten largest mutual funds participate in shareholder litigation. We find that although shareholder suits offer potential benefits, the largest mutual funds have essentially forfeited their use of litigation. This finding is particularly striking given that index funds and other long-termorientedmutual funds generally cannot sell their shares when they are dissatisfied with company performance, leaving them with only two levers in corporate governance—voting and suing. Mutual funds vote, but they do not sue. We analyze potential explanations for the failure ofmutual funds to litigate on behalf of their investors. Collective action problems and conflicts of interest raise significant obstacles to mutual fund participation in shareholder litigation. Yet, we argue, there are situations in which shareholder litigation could create value for mutual fund investors. We therefore turn to the normative question: How should mutual funds litigate on behalf of their investors? Answering this question allows us to articulate a mission statement for mutual funds in shareholder litigation. Our mission statement is grounded on the perspective of the broadly diversified ""market investor."" The repeat-play incentives and broad diversification of many mutual funds, index funds in particular, suggests that they could create value by focusing principally on deterrence objectives. Mutual funds should bring shareholder suits against portfolio companies when doing so would meaningfully enhance deterrence. They should also scrutinize the litigation brought by other shareholders, objecting to outcomes that fail to promote meaningful deterrence. At the same time, mutual funds should focus on compensatory goals in litigation against nonportfolio defendants because extraportfolio claims do not raise circularity concerns. In addition, mutual funds should consider whether litigation can be used to implement corporate governance reforms. Finally, in all cases, mutual funds should closely monitor litigation agency costs. We close by suggesting ways in which the incentives of mutual funds might be restructured to bring about these changes.",,

This assumption, however, has rarely been tested directly. We surveyed 100 4- to 11-year-olds removed from home because of maltreatment about their placement preferences. Children were less likely to indicate they wanted to return home if they were placed with siblings or with kin, consistent with statutory placement preferences.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the extent to which different types of questions in child sexual abuse interviews elicited subjective content, namely emotional reactions, cognitive content, and physical sensations. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study included transcripts of 205 Child Advocacy Center interviews with 4- to 12-year-old children alleging sexual abuse. METHODS: We coded questions for question type, distinguishing among invitations, wh- questions, yes/no and forced-choice questions, and suggestive questions. We coded both questions and answers for whether they referenced subjective content. RESULTS: When questions did not reference subjective content, the most productive questions were invitations, though they elicited subjective content less than 5% of the time. When questions specifically referenced subjective content, children were likely to explicitly mention such content, particularly in response to ""how feel"" and ""what think"" questions. Children's responsiveness and productivity was enhanced by requests to elaborate on their subjective responses, and both emotional and physical reactions could be elicited. There was little evidence of non-responsiveness or counterintuitive reactions to abuse. Younger children were less likely than older children to provide subjective responses to questions that did not reference subjective content, but were no less likely to do so when asked questions with subjective content. CONCLUSIONS: Children, even young children, can be successfully encouraged to provide subjective content about sexual abuse, particularly when free recall questions are supplemented with ""how feel"" or ""what think"" questions.",,

Although neglect constitutes a large proportion of maltreatment experiences, relatively little attention has been directed toward understanding whether and how children disclose neglect. The overarching aim of the present study was to document this process by comparing disclosure patterns in cases of neglect to those in cases of sexual abuse. Method Redacted jurisdiction reports (N = 136) of substantiated dependency cases of neglect (n = 71) and sexual abuse (n = 65) in 4- to 17-year-olds were coded for why maltreatment was suspected, and for children's perceived awareness and disclosure of the maltreatment. Results Neglect was most often initially suspected via contact with emergency services (e.g., police, emergency medical services), whereas sexual abuse was most often initially suspected as a result of children's statements. Children evidenced greater perceived awareness of sexual abuse than neglect and were more likely to disclose the former in their first investigative interview. Perceived awareness was further associated with a higher likelihood of children's statements initiating discovery of maltreatment and disclosing in the first investigative interview. Conclusions Children may benefit from greater knowledge about their needs for safety, supervision, and provision in the home, which could increase the likelihood they would disclose neglect. Such, in turn, could lead to earlier interventions for children and families.",,

Objectives: The present study evaluated whether placement-related factors known to predict youth's well-being also shape their placement preferences and whether preferences differ between youth below and above the age at which they are considered legally competent to provide input. Method: Data (N = 1033, ages 6–17 years, 54 % female) were obtained from NSCAW-I. Youth were asked open- and closed-ended questions about their placement preferences. Results: Among youth removed for shorter periods, placement with kin was related to a greater preference for their current placement (RRR = 0.31, p < .001) and desire for permanency in that placement (OR = 1.95, p = .005) relative to youth placed with non-kin. However, youth removed for longer periods (e.g., a year) were similar in their desires for their current placement to be permanent regardless of whether they were living with kin or non-kin caregivers. Among younger youth, placement with siblings (RRR = 0.42, p = .015) was linked to a preference for their current placement. Racial match between youth and their non-kin caregiver was unrelated to their placement preferences. Conclusions: Findings revealed that both younger and older youth's placement preferences were shaped by factors objectively linked to youth's well-being and thus align with best practices in placement decisions.

Various contributing factors have been identified such as larger acoustic speech variability including mispronunciations due to continuing biological changes in growth, developing vocabulary and linguistic skills, and scarcity of training corpora. A further challenge arises when dealing with spontaneous speech of children involved in a conversational interaction, and especially when the child may have limited or impaired communication ability. This includes health applications, one of the motivating domains of this paper, that involve goal-oriented dyadic interactions between a child and clinician/adult social partner as a part of behavioral assessment. In this work, we use linguistic context information from the interaction to adapt speech recognition models for children speech. Specifically, spoken language from the interacting adult speech provides the context for the child’s speech. We propose two methods to exploit this context: lexical repetitions and semantic response generation. For the latter, we make use of sequence-to-sequence models that learn to predict the target child utterance given context adult utterances. Long-term context is incorporated in the model by propagating the cell-state across the duration of conversation. We use interpolation techniques to adapt language models at the utterance level, and analyze the effect of length and direction of context (forward and backward). Two different domains are used in our experiments to demonstrate the generalized nature of our methods - interactions between a child with ASD and an adult social partner in a play-based, naturalistic setting, and in forensic interviews between a child and a trained interviewer. In both cases, context-adapted models yield significant improvement (upto 10.71% in absolute word error rate) over the baseline and perform consistently across context windows and directions. Using statistical analysis, we investigate the effect of source-based (adult) and target-based (child) factors on adaptation methods. Our results demonstrate the applicability of our modeling approach in improving child speech recognition by employing information transfer from the adult interlocutor.",,

Asking children about a sequence of events as a whole (in particular using ""first"") could avoid order of encoding biases, because children would not have to answer questions about events within the sequence.

One alternative method to human lie-detectors is using computer-based linguistic analysis which may present a more reliable method for detecting dishonesty. Moreover, while previous research has examined linguistic differences between typically developing children’s and adults’ truthful and dishonest reports, no study to date has examined whether maltreated children exhibit different linguistic cues to dishonesty. Thus, the current study examined maltreated and nonmaltreated children’s linguistic and syntactic cues to children’s truthful and dishonest reports.MethodsNine- to 12-year-olds, half of whom were maltreated, played a computer game with a confederate: half of the children experienced a transgression (i.e., playing a forbidden game and crashing the computer) and were coached to conceal it, and half of the children experienced no transgression (i.e., simply played a computer game). All children were then interviewed about the event. The current study utilized automated linguistic and syntactic analysis software to compare children’s truthful reports (no transgression occurred) with dishonest reports.Results and DiscussionResults indicated that maltreated and non-maltreated children did not differ in their indicators of dishonesty. Dishonest reporters used more first-person plural pronouns and cognitive mechanism terms and had less syntactically complex reports compared to truthful reporters. Finally, first-personal plural pronouns, cognitive mechanism terms, and syntactic complexity accurately classified (74.2%) the veracity of children’s reports. The current findings present a new indicator of dishonesty (syntactic complexity) and suggest that indicators from typically developing populations may apply to maltreated children when coaching occurred.",,

However, the story changes considerably when one looks at the history of citizenship and nationality among Algerian Jews and Muslims outside of Algeria. In Tunisia and Morocco, where many people from Algeria migrated, the Crémieux degree had a relatively negligible impact in how Algerian Jews and Muslims were classified and in their relationship to French diplomatic authorities.

To the Uttermost Parts of the Earth masterfully rewrites the history of international law along these lines. In these pages, the usual suspects share space with thinkers better known for their contributions to other fields, such as Machiavelli, Adam Smith, and Jeremy Bentham.

Elmilik aligned himself with Jews and Christians who believed in the need to modernize and Europeanize Tunisia. He pursued this goal through his involvement in the local branch of the Alliance Israélite Universelle (an international Jewish organization based in Paris), his publications in a French Jewish newspaper, and his membership in a local masonic lodge. In all these arenas, he joined a chorus of European voices decrying the abuses of Jews at the hands of Tunisian government officials. But after he accepted a job working for a Tunisian government official in 1873, Elmilik began regularly defending the Tunisian state’s treatment of its Jews. Rather than presume that Elmilik was a janus-faced opportunist, I argue that his different, at times opposed engagements were representative of the multiple repositories in which Jews located their rights. Rights were central to the construction of belonging; by examining the various guarantors of rights to which Jews appealed, we can glimpse the multiple levels of belonging that Jews – and to some extent Muslims – cultivated in the pre-colonial Maghrib.",,

As John Matsusaka reveals in Let the People Rule, this belief is based in fact. Over the past century, while democratic governments have become more efficient, they have also become more disconnected from the people they purport to represent. The solution Matsusaka advances is familiar but surprisingly underused: direct democracy, in the form of referendums. While this might seem like a dangerous idea post-Brexit, there is a great deal of evidence that, with careful design and thoughtful implementation, referendums can help bridge the growing gulf between the government and the people. Drawing on examples from around the world, Matsusaka shows how direct democracy can bring policies back in line with the will of the people (and provide other benefits, like curbing corruption). Taking lessons from failed processes like Brexit, he also describes what issues are best suited to referendums and how they should be designed, and he tackles questions that have long vexed direct democracy: can voters be trusted to choose reasonable policies, and can minority rights survive majority decisions? The result is one of the most comprehensive examinations of direct democracy to date—coupled with concrete, nonpartisan proposals for how countries can make the most of the powerful tools that referendums offer. With a crisis of representation hobbling democracies across the globe, Let the People Rule offers important new ideas about the crucial role the referendum can play in the future of government.",,

During 2007–19, the market reacted positively when the SEC permitted exclusion, which suggests that investors viewed those proposals as value reducing on average. We also find that a company’s stock price decreased over time while waiting for an SEC decision, which suggests that challenged proposals imposed distraction costs on companies. The SEC’s decisions can be predicted by regulatory rules but are also related to a proposal’s predicted votes—more popular types of proposals were less likely to be removed. We find no robust evidence that no-action-letter decisions differed when the SEC was controlled by Democrats versus Republicans. Taken together, the evidence suggests that managers may be serving shareholder interests in opposing some proposals and that the no-action-letter process may be helping shareholders by weeding out value-reducing proposals.",,

It did not come easily or quickly. When the academic economist first published his massive text, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, in French in 2013, summarizing over a decade of his and others’ work on capital and its unequal ownership across time and cultures, he encountered a friendly but muted reception on the continent.1 No bother: Prophets are typically without honor in their own native land. Piketty’s time came in the following year, the spring of 2014, when the English translation of his magnum opus appeared.2 Spurred on by favorable reviews from the likes of Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman (“Capital in the Twenty- First Century . . . is a bona fide phenomenon,” Krugman declared in the New York Times), the nearly seven hundred page economics book made surprising and sustained appearances on all forms of best-seller lists.3 Overnight, Piketty became the unlikeliest of oxymorons: a “Rock-Star Economist,” and a wealthy one at that.4 It might have seemed that, in the millennia-long battle to get the rich to pay their fair share of a just society’s burdens, a glimmer of hope had sprung forth. Years later, what has become of that hope? Academics have debated Piketty’s work, as academics do.5 Critics have criticized and defenders have defended Piketty’s sense of the facts of capital (it is held unequally, and inequality is getting worse); the normative ramifications of those facts (Piketty thinks they are bad); and what, if anything, to do about them (Piketty says tax the rich).6 Piketty himself has followed up with a sequel, Capital and Ideology, weighing in at over 1000 pages, roughly half again longer than Capital in the Twenty- First Century.7",,

Amplification, or the size of the audience reached by speech, lies at the heart of many contemporary free speech struggles. Yet the concept is surprisingly absent as a category of analysis from constitutional doctrine and virtually undiscussed in legal scholarship. Amplification deserves its own set of legal rules and doctrines, because the right to amplify one’s speech serves the two core types of First Amendment interests—those of audiences and those of speakers—differently than the right to choose the content of one’s speech. The higher the degree of amplification, the greater the disparity. When it comes to audience interests, amplification via mass media platforms has unique potential to distort the marketplace of ideas that informs voting audiences. When it comes to speaker interests, greater amplification has only diminishing marginal returns for the speaker’s primary interest in autonomy, understood as the capacity for living one’s own life, because speakers need very large audiences neither to (a) form their own life plans nor (b) have the motivation to act on them. Thus, the right to amplify speech to very large audiences is justified by its benefits for audience interests rather than speaker interests, and so may be constitutionally regulated to preserve the integrity of democratic discourse for audiences. A central practical upshot is that certain carefully drafted legal rules on amplification, including campaign finance laws and social media regulations, should survive constitutional scrutiny",,

Who was found on the roads in the societies of the Western world, and how did meetings between different social groups take place? According to what criteria were routes chosen or even imposed: rank, class, gender, or function? What objects did the travelers take with them? What knowledge was accessible? And what meanings were ascribed to the road? What fantasies were invested in it? Since antiquity, novels have taken the road as a privileged setting because it embodied a perfect “sociotope,” the place par excellence where people normally separated by social hierarchy or by space could meet and at the same time ostentatiously display social division, where destinies mingled and intrigues were woven. It is up to the historian to reread these narratives in the light of other sources, to put mobility to the test of social differentiation, and, beyond a study of practices, to pose the question of spatial justice. Although space is naturally common, it is often “qualified” by the people who move in it, and access to it can be subject to tension and conflict, or even the abuse of power.",,

The article reframes Foucauldian theory through a dialectic with the theories of Marc Ancel, a prominent figure in the emergence of liberal sentencing norms in France. Ancel and Foucault were contemporaries whose legacies are intertwined. Ancel defended more benevolent prisons where experts would rehabilitate offenders. This evokes exactly what Discipline and Punish cast as an insidious strategy of social control. In reality, Foucault and Ancel converged in intriguing ways. The dialectic offers another perspective on Foucault, whose theories have fostered skepticism about the possibility of progress. While mass incarceration’s rise in the United States may evoke a Foucauldian dystopia, the relative development of human rights and dignity in European punishment reflects aspirations that Foucault embraced as an activist concerned about fatalistic interpretations of his theories.",,

The authors showcase a particularly successful case involving defense contractor General Dynamics and explain why that company was so successful at something very few other companies have achieved. Faced with very poor prospects for the defense industry, GD increased the wealth of its shareholders by more than 500% in the three years from January 1, 1990, when sharp defense spending cuts were confirmed after the end of the Cold War, to January 1993. The downsizing, restructuring, and partial liquidation of General Dynamics was a remarkable economic achievement in three important respects. First, managing effectively in a declining business environment required dramatic changes in traditional corporate policies, particularly compensation policies. Second, GD's operating changes had to be closely coordinated with a series of complicated corporate financial transactions that were unprecedented for GD. Third, senior management had to confront extraordinary public relations, political, and labor union challenges. The successful plan involved providing high-powered and front-loaded equity incentives for the (largely new) GD senior management team, asset sales, radically lower capex budgets, sharply higher dividends, and aggressive share repurchases.

Second, I respond to some of the objections Laborde presses against my conception of political liberalism. Third, I argue that Laborde is mistaken in adopting accessibility as the appropriate standard for reasons within public justification. Finally, I suggest that Laborde’s view is, in the end, too accommodating to perfectionism in politics. Her view allows laws and public policies to promote particular religions or controversial conceptions of the good life when certain conditions are met, but this, I argue, is inconsistent with the foundational ideals of freedom and equality.",,

It is clear that in order for these institutions to reclaim their respected status requires an examination and rebuilding of the ethical foundations of higher education. This book gathers faculty and administrators from highly respected schools to examine the current situation and mark directions for change. Chapters address such topics as privacy, shared governance, grievance procedures, accountability, adjunct instructors, student athletes, campus policing, pedagogy and rubric review, libraries and access to information, aging faculty, international students, secrecy and public relations, and the corporatization of universities.Reviewing the challenges and opportunities that face higher education, this book argues that what holds institutions together over time are the values, principles, and traditions that contribute to moral character and lay a foundation for institutional integrity.Contributors: Michael Boylan, Cher Weixia Chen, Zenon Culverhouse, Darin Dockstader, Cora Drozd, Robert Labaree, Jonathan Liljeblad, Matthew Mahrt, Rita Manning, Glen Miller, Melissa L.

The challenges may include language barriers, lack of familiarity with scientific research protocols, and overt or subtle forms of coercion. Some of notorious historical examples of failure to obtain informed human subjects in scientific experimentation are considered. When scholars collaborate on projects with colleagues overseas, serious questions arise as to whether the researchers should be required to make occasional on-site visits to monitor compliance with ethics standards, whether failure to fulfill this responsibility should require IRBs of universities to withhold approval for such research, and finally, how to evaluate human rights conditions in countries that do not adhere to international standards. As research is becoming more transnational, the challenges posed by these collaborations across borders deserve much more attention. To address widely recognized problems in the research process, more and more world conferences on scientific integrity are being convened. There is an urgent need to find legitimate ways to protect scientific integrity and human subjects via policies that can be enforced.",,

The virus had ravaged the nation—19 million were already infected, with 300,000 deaths, and counting1—and more suffering and loss were expected before the next spring’s thaw. New York officials knew the media coverage of this first recipient would, therefore, be seen as a symbol of American values; the recipient would reflect our current understanding of merit and deservingness. Should the first recipient be the intellectually greatest and the best of us—perhaps a key scientist who developed the vaccine—or the least and most vulnerable—perhaps an anonymous, elderly impoverished soul, desperately in need of protection? Given the scarcity of doses as the vaccines were first introduced, Americans had questions about who merited being first in line for treatment.

This theory entails novel arguments in favor of imposing additional tax burdens on the most well-off members of our society and taxing capital income by demonstrating the extent to which unequal market outcomes are undeserved. Technological developments have led to winner-take-all markets in which even small amounts of option luck can lead to a wide divergence in results. A further tax imposed on the winners of such markets helps neutralize the economic inequalities resulting from luck. Differences in capital income are partly unjust because differential returns to investments are attributable, in large part, to chance. A tax on capital income compresses the distribution of these returns by lowering the returns to winning bets (by taxing such returns) and the losses of losing bets (by allowing deductions for such losses).",,

The authors of this essay offer a different view. They argue that Chile’s constitution-making process, as designed by the multiparty agreement, manifests a double aversion: to avoid the Bolivarian way of constitution-making—including its associated constituent power narrative—and to put an end to the institutional and symbolic legacy of the Pinochet regime. In attempting to stay clear of these two negative models, the authors argue that the rules of the constitution-making process have adopted the main features of the post-sovereign model of constitution-making.",,

The authors identify and reconstruct the two prevailing normative theories underlying the Chilean constitution-making process: the evolutive and the revolutionary narratives. These present themselves in both radical and moderate versions. While evolutive ideas emphasize institutional continuity, consensus-building, and an incrementalist approach to constitutional change, revolutionary arguments rely on the constituent power theory and push for a profound social transformation that can break with the past. Even though these narratives are in tension with each other in many respects, they have both influenced the design of the rules of the constitution-making process.

Thus, Political Liberalism does not accommodate this view; it excludes it from the possibility of a reasonable overlapping consensus. The second strand in Stopler’s article can be interpreted as an invitation to think about the value of idealization in political theory. More concretely, this article argues that Stopler’s claims can be read as suggesting that political liberalism’s flaw is not that it tolerates illiberal views, but that it tells us little about how to achieve and maintain an overlapping consensus about justice in the kind of societies we actually inhabit. This article briefly argues that this critique deserves attention, especially given the circumstances of today’s societies, where extreme views are not uncommon and the effects of climate change threaten the very possibility of justice.",,

And populists as well as non-populists have resisted international institutions. This essay questions the assumption that populists have an antagonistic relationship with international law, and argues that this assumption lacks robust empirical support and is theoretically underdeveloped. Latin America is a particularly significant site for challenging this assumption, given the prominent role of the executive in foreign relations2 and the rich intellectual history regarding populism itself. The essay concludes by stressing the need for developing a theoretical framework for the study of populism and international law, which international legal scholarship currently lacks. Such a framework should be less Euro-centric and less normatively biased: it should not assume that resistance to international law is always without merit. And it should also allow us to identify what is distinctively populist about populism's relation with international law and which aspects are mediated by populism's host ideologies.",,

First, there are two methodological obstacles that counsel against constructing ‘a populist approach to international law’: populism varies significantly depending on its definition of ‘the people’ and international law is a fragmented regime. Second, the opposition between a ‘law of coordination’ and a ‘law of cooperation’ to which Krieger resorts is misleading, for it obscures the fact that the value of cooperation and coordination lies primarily in the values for which we coordinate and cooperate. As such, I argue that this opposition may make us partially blind to two important dangers that some forms of populism may pose right now: their cooperating to reshape international law and institutions according to (some) of their values and their refusing to cooperate or coordinate in the achievement of urgent goals. Nonetheless, I conclude that the precise shape of these dangers – as well as how to resist them – remains blurry if we do not pay proper attention to the ways in which different forms of populism define ‘the people’.",,

This article argues that ""right-wing populism"" is not a ""reasonable comprehensive view"" under Rawls's theory. Thus, Political Liberalism does not accommodate this view; it excludes it from the possibility of a reasonable overlapping consensus. The second strand in Stopler's article can be interpreted as an invitation to think about the value of idealization in political theory. More concretely, this article argues that Stopler's claims can be read as suggesting that political liberalism's flaw is not that it tolerates illiberal views, but that it tells us little about how to achieve and maintain an overlapping consensus about justice in the kind of societies we actually inhabit. This article briefly argues that this critique deserves attention, especially given the circumstances of today's societies, where extreme views are not uncommon and the effects of climate change threaten the very possibility of justice.",,

After briefly canvassing preliminary research about the effects of the pandemic on academic women, it discusses the gendered division of caregiving responsibilities, both inside the family and in academic institutions. Through the lens of feminist theory, the article aims to understand what can be perceived as a kind of paradox or contradiction: on the one hand, there is something deeply predictable about the fact that women have shouldered relatively disproportionate caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic. On the other hand, and because these gendered effects are so predictable, there is something somewhat perplexing in the lack of institutional response. This article explains what is predictable about the phenomenon as an instantiation of misogyny and the gendered division of labor-a reproduction of already existing issues. The somewhat perplexing nature of the phenomenon comes from the lack of institutional response to deeply predictable effects, but it is also related to how resilient the gendered nature of caregiving obligations has proven to be, even during the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic. This resilience, the article suggests, might be explained by the intersection of misogyny and economic exploitation.",,

Many of these children are unaccompanied by parents or relatives when they arrive at the U.S. border. Others who are accompanied by parents or relatives are rendered unaccompanied when U.S. immigration authorities separate them upon apprehension. Together, these minors are called unaccompanied alien children (UACs) and transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), unless and until their immigration cases are resolved or until the children can be placed with a sponsor in the United States pending the adjudication of their immigration cases. In fiscal year 2019, the ORR held the highest number of UACs in its UAC program history.This study presents the first systematic empirical investigation of children in ORR custody using original administrative records pertaining to migrant children who were in ORR custody between November 2017 and August 2019. Our analysis reveals an increasing number and proportion of children in U.S. custody who are extremely vulnerable: girls, young children of tender age (260 of whom are U.S. citizens), and children emigrating from countries with high rates of crime and violence. This trend suggests that insofar as punitive immigration enforcement policies may have deterred some children from undertaking the dangerous journey to the United States, those who continue to arrive at the U.S. border are likely children who are most in need of special care and legal protection.",,

But do lawyers matter more in cases decided by certain types of judges than others? Do lawyers matter more in certain political, legal, and organizational contexts than others? We explore these questions by investigating removal proceedings in the United States—a court process in which immigration judges decide whether to admit noncitizens into the United States or deport them. Drawing on over 1.9 million removal proceedings decided between 1998 and 2020, we examine whether the representation effect (the increased probability of a favorable outcome associated with legal representation) depends on judge characteristics and contextual factors. We find that the representation effect is larger among female (than male) judges and among more experienced judges. In addition, the representation effect is larger during Democratic presidential administrations, in immigration courts located in the Ninth Circuit, and in times of increasing caseload. These findings suggest that the representation effect depends on who the judge is and their decisional environment, and that increasing noncitzens' access to counsel—even of high quality—might be insufficient under current circumstances to ensure fair and consistent outcomes in immigration courts.",,

The two policies that the current study examines are immigration detention and nonjudicial removals. The survey results provide no evidence that a heightened awareness of these US immigration enforcement policies affects individuals’ intentions to migrate to the United States. But heightened awareness about the widespread use of immigration detention in the United States does negatively impact individuals’ assessments about the procedural and outcome fairness of the US immigration system.

Using originally compiled court data on removal proceedings decided between 2019 and 2020, we applied a difference‐in‐differences framework to produce three key findings. First, consistent with theory of event stigma, Chinese respondents experienced a significantly higher removal rate during the early pandemic period. Second, consistent with theory of associative stigma, East and Southeast (E/SE) Asian respondents also experienced a significantly higher removal rate during the early pandemic period. Third, the removal rate declined for both Chinese and E/SE respondents during the later pandemic period, but this decline was more gradual and lagged for E/SE Asian than for Chinese respondents. Finally, increases in the number of cases involving Chinese respondents increased the removal rate for E/SE Asian respondents during the early months of the pandemic. The last two findings suggest that associative or indirect stigmatization may be harder to combat than direct stigmatization owing to the implicit nature of bias underlying associative stigma. This study highlights the socially constructed nature of national origin groups, and the importance of both direct and indirect stigmatization in the production of social inequality.",,

The Grand Chamber began to adopt judgments which, in turn, provoked an unprecedented wave of ‘Walking-Back Dissents’. Such dissents are separate opinions that, in effect, accuse the majority of a Grand Chamber of ‘tacitly overturn[ing] prior rulings or settled doctrine in favour of national governments’ (H-V, p. 823). In an expansive conclusion, H-V suggest that the ECtHR has also generated a rising number of ‘Walking-Back Judgments’, which lower standards of rights protection. We reject H-V’s major claims on the empirical evidence. The outcomes of Brighton and subsequent conferences did not pose a credible threat to the Court, and could not have induced it to ‘walk back’ rights protection. We also closely examined two sets of Walking-Back Dissents identified by H-V, focusing on judgments that would be ‘most likely to fit’ H-V’s ‘expectations’. We found that fewer than one in four judgments analysed actually contained a Walking-Back Dissent. And we identified only one plausible Walking-Back Judgment. We are confident that H-V’s results are inaccurate and cannot be reproduced by external analysts. We conclude by noting factors that H-V do not consider, but that are crucial to understanding the ECtHR’s decision-making.

However, far less attention has been paid to factors that may influence states’ modification of their treaty obligations via reservations. We theorize that states will be more likely to enter reservations when treaty obligations increase compliance costs and policy adjustment costs. More specifically, we expect that demanding provisions, i.e., provisions that create strong, precise obligations requiring domestic action, will enhance the likelihood of reservation. To test our theory, we exploit an original dataset that codes reservations at the provision (treaty–article–paragraph) level for the ten core international human rights treaties. Consistent with our expectations, we find that states are more likely to enter reservations on more demanding treaty provisions. In contrast to prior studies, our results indicate that reservations are not driven purely by state-level characteristics such as regime type or the nature of the legal system. Rather, it appears that states weigh individual treaty obligations and calibrate their commitments accordingly.",,

We argue that claims of norm death are empirically incorrect and theoretically misleading. Norms rarely die, and the processes that happen instead are far more complex. The idea of norm death embodies two misconceptions borne out of methodological incentives in empirical constructivism; that norms are single entities that exist separately from larger structures, and that compliance is the most effective way to measure if a norm is under challenge. We argue that the literature on “norm death” epitomizes the pitfalls of this approach, and as a result neither empirically or theoretically captures what happens when norms are under challenge. Norms are fundamentally resilient and can withstand even high levels of non-compliance. We examine four cases of alleged norm death—the norms against mercenary use, unrestricted submarine warfare, and torture, and the norm requiring declarations of war—and demonstrate that in these cases norms are not disappearing, but are rather subject to processes of obsolescence, replacement, and modification. We further argue that once we recognize that norms are embedded in wider structures, and move away from the notion that compliance indicates norm strength, it is possible to see why norms are generally resilient.",,

In agriculture, for example, self-spreading viruses have been proposed as insecticides, or as vectors to modify planted crops. In health care, self-spreading viruses have been promoted as vaccines (1, 2). Yet, glossed over by these proposals is that the self-spreading dynamics of a virus repeatedly passing from host-to-host (passaging) give it substantial potential to alter its biological properties once released into the environment (see the box).

Methods: This was a retrospective, nonrandomized, case series study of telemedicine-based neurological management in an urban academic medical center from October 2018 to June 2020. We estimated roundtrip travel time, roundtrip travel distance, total savings, and surveyed patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine care. We supported these findings through evaluation of 7,194 patients by telemedicine and conducted 9,189 video visits for neurological care. Results: The median telemedicine patient avoided a roundtrip driving distance of 33 miles and roundtrip travel time of 75 min. Within sample, median hourly earnings were $27/h.

While the positive effects of competition are beyond dispute, this article contends that competitive situations also trigger a particular psychological mindset that can distort contestants’ judgment and lead to suboptimal courses of action. The article presents a theoretical framework that consists of a myside bias, by which people adopt a self-serving view of the competition, evaluate themselves favorably, and evaluate their counterpart unfavorably. The framework also proposes the construct of otherside bias, by which people impute to their counterparts distortions that are similar, but opposite, to their own. The combined effect of these biases is to fuel conflict-promoting behavior. Next, the article presents 2 experiments designed to test this framework. Using minimalistic experimental treatments, we find that participants assigned to adversarial roles display the myside and otherside biases. The primary objective of this paper is to offer a comprehensive account of the psychological mindset evoked by competitive situations. We integrate findings established across a variety of research fields into a unifying theoretical framework and demonstrate experimentally their joint impact on this important domain of human judgment and behavior. We propose that coherence-based reasoning serves as the cognitive backbone of the framework, in that the array of judgments are intricately interconnected and organized in a coherence maximizing representational structure both within and between the myside and otherside biases. Finally, we briefly discuss some of the framework’s implications for a variety of legal domains, including negotiations, litigation, expert testimony, and police investigations.

However, in some instances, the mechanisms of both collusion and detection can be transformed using AI. This chapter discusses existing theoretical and empirical work, and identifies research gaps as well as avenues for new scholarship on how firms or competition authorities might invest in AI compliance to improve detection of wrongdoing. We suggest where AI collusion is possible and offer new twists to where prior work has not identified possible collusion. Specifically, we identify the importance of AI in addressing the “trust” issue in collusion. We also identify that AI collusion is possible across nonprice dimensions, such as manipulated product reviews and ratings, and discuss potential screens involving co-movements of prices and ratings. We further emphasize that AI may encourage entry, which may limit collusive prospects. Finally, we discuss how AI can be used to help with compliance both at the firm level and by competition authorities.",,

Once speculators discovered the rich reserves, they hoped the new industry would displace the plantation economy that had been lucrative for only a few farmers in the post-Civil War era. In 1899, prospectors dug an eleven-hundred-foot shaft, finding not oil but the bones of African Americans murdered twenty-six years earlier at Colfax LA by white supremacists who had wrested control of the Grant Parish government from the Republicans. In thinking through questions of democratic legitimacy and the scope of political rights, one cannot divorce them from the broader political context in which they exist.

It is urgent for the Court to understand the informational benefits of campaign finance disclosure, so it may avoid this collision. Campaign finance transparency teaches us more than one-dimensional information about the candidate’s left- or right-leaning policy preferences. It also helps us learn about candidate type. Social scientists, including myself, have run several studies examining voter learning from campaign finance information. As I explain in this Article, when voters learn about a candidate’s position with regard to dark money, they learn and vote differently than if they did not have that information. Experimental and observational research also suggests that voters punish noncompliance and reward overcompliance. In other words, transparency about campaign finance disclosure and compliance informs voters. These findings point to useful policy innovations for states and cities, while the federal government is unable or unwilling to regulate. The innovations I propose include “disclosure disclaimers,” which inform voters about the presence of dark money in a campaign, and campaign finance audits, which inform voters about compliance with campaign finance laws. But more basic loophole-closing can also provide helpful information to voters. I explain implications for the courts, campaigns, and policymakers, as well as limitations on the argument.",,

And what is the risk that other branches of government could be captured? In this project, we offer a critical review of regulatory—or industry-related—capture that we use to build a concept of state capture that extends beyond agency-specific accounts and incorporates both the structures and processes of governing, while centering our examination on the public. We use state-level data on campaign finance, lobbying, industry size, ethics, and transparency to measure the degree to which the fifty state executive, legislative, and judicial branches are at risk of capture by the dominant industries in the state. We then test our measures of risk against policies that departed so far from public opinion that scholars suspect capture may have been at play. Finally, we discuss judicial review of agency action in the face of suspected capture. Courts should use a heightened level of scrutiny where risk of capture is high. However, we also point out that elected judges—particularly those who run for re-election—are vulnerable to the same pressures that legislators endure when it comes to the risk of influence via campaign finance. In those cases in which a judge’s campaign financing is dominated by the industry affected by the agency action or statute, the judge should recuse. And policymakers concerned about judicial capture should create a narrow presumption for litigants to remove the case to federal court.",,

In this Article, we apply innovations in statistical methods to the universe of campaign contributions for federal elections and analyze the racial distribution of money in American politics between 1980 and 2012. We find that white people are extremely over-represented among donors. This racial gap in campaign contributions is significantly greater than the gap between white and nonwhite voter participation and white and nonwhite officer holders. It is also relatively constant across time and elected offices. This result is an important missing piece in the conversation about equity in political participation. We argue that the courts and Congress should take steps to address the racial gaps in campaign finance participation. The participation and representation problems that flow from racial inequality in deregulated campaign finance could inform claims under the Voting Rights Act (VRA), and politico-financial inequalities certainly bear on the normative problems that the statute intends to address. But the most politically viable way to address the campaign finance racial gap lies in adoption of public financing for political campaigns, which offer the promise of increasing the racial representation of campaign contributions. When racial representation in contributions is improved, improved equality in the distribution of resources and power in electoral and political systems should follow.",,

We obtained 525,796 ads with FEC-registered advertisers from Facebook's ad library that ran between August-November 2018. We compare ads run by candidates, parties, and outside groups, which we classify by (i) their donor transparency (dark money or disclosed) and (ii) the group's permanence (disappearing after 2018 or re-registering). Ads run by dark money and disappearing outside groups were more negative than transparent and re-registering groups, respectively. Outside groups as a whole also ran more negative ads than candidates and parties. These results suggest that transparency for political speech is associated with advertising tone: the most negative advertising comes from organizations with less donor disclosure and permanence.",,
