In determining overall alignment with human rights standards to respect, protect, and fulfil sexual health-related rights without discrimination, there are many aspects of laws, including their specificity and content, which impact which sexual health services and information are availed, which are restricted, and for whom. To understand the nature of existing legal provisions surrounding access to sexual health services and information, we analysed the content of 40 laws in English, French, and Spanish from 18 countries for the specific sexual health services and information to which access is ensured or prohibited, and the non-discrimination provisions within these laws. Overall, there was wide variation across countries in the types of laws covering these services and the types and number of services and information ensured. Some countries covered different services through multiple laws, and most of the laws dedicated specifically to sexual health addressed only a narrow aspect of sexual health and covered a small range of services. The protected characteristics in non-discrimination provisions and the specificity of these provisions with regard to sexual health services also varied. Findings may inform national legal and policy dialogues around sexual health to identify opportunities for positive change, as well as to guide further investigation to understand the relationship between such legal provisions, the implementation of these laws within countries, and relevant sexual health outcomes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26410397.2024.2336770,2024,Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters,,,,,,,,,

The World Health Organization has published several definitions of self-care, including in a 2019 Global Guideline rooted in sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), later expanded to encompass health more generally. To establish a robust understanding of self-care, this exploratory study inventorises, consolidates, presents and analyses definitions of self-care beyond the SRHR field. A pragmatic review identified definitions and conceptualisations of self-care from peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2009 and 2021. The search identified 91 definitions of self-care from 116 relevant publications. Data extraction informed analysis to identify recurring themes and approaches, revealing three key areas of variation: self-care being: (1) defined directly or descriptively; (2) situated within individual, interpersonal or structural contexts; (3) defined broadly or topic-specifically. A multilevel conceptualisation can guide a more broadly applicable understanding of self-care: first, as an aspect of healthcare; second, as a concept operating at individual, interpersonal and institutional levels; third, as a concept that impacts specific health fields and contexts differently. A comprehensive but adaptable framework works in service of improving health and wellbeing for all, acknowledging the linkages between self-care and health-related human rights.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2023.2296970,2024,Global Public Health,,,,,,,,,

Dianiska et al.,,Building Rapport in Interviews with Adolescent Trafficking Victims,"Though much is known about children's sexual abuse disclosure, less attention has been directed towards disclosure in other types of youthful victims, especially those who may be reluctant to tell due to either normative development or victims' specific experiences. Trafficked youth, particularly those who are adolescents, represent one such group. Understanding how suspected youth trafficking victims are questioned by authorities, especially with respect to establishing rapport and trust, is important for informing professionals how to effectively question this unique population of victims to overcome their reluctance. We examined transcripts of interviews conducted by federal interviewers (n = 12,653 question-answer turns across 33 interviews) and police (n = 4,972 question-answer turns across 14 interviews) with trafficked youth between the ages of 12 and 18. Interviews were reliably coded for the length of pre-substantive questioning, provision of instructions and ground rules, and use of rapport building and supportive strategies. Federal interviewers used pre-substantive instructions and built rapport with potential victims more often than police did. Also, and although infrequently used overall, supportive interviewing strategies were evident more often by federal interviewers than police.

Study 1 Objective Study 1 surveyed forensic interviewers' use of and attitudes about the birthday narrative. Participants and setting Participants included 170 forensic interviewers who subscribed to a webinar promoting use of the birthday narrative (Mage = 43 years, SD = 10.2, 94 % female). Results Over half (55 %) of interviewers reported that they rarely/never asked about children's birthdays, and non-users were especially likely to view the birthday narrative as never/rarely productive. Although interviewers viewed memory difficulties as more likely to occur with the birthday narrative than other practice topics (the child's likes, the child's day), non-users did not view memory difficulties, reluctance, generic reports, or religious objections as especially problematic. Open-ended responses identified negative experiences with the birthday as an additional concern, and interviewers' recommended wording of the prompts suggested suboptimal questioning strategies. Study 2 Objective Study 2 assessed the use of the birthday narrative in forensic interviews. Participants and setting The sample included 350 forensic interviews with 4- to 12-year-old children (Mage = 8.85, SD = 2.59). Results Only 4 % of children failed to recall substantive information if interviewers persisted, though another 11 % failed when interviewers stopped persisting. Invitations were more effective than other question types, especially among older children. 21 % of children mentioned a negative detail during their narrative.

Wylie et al.,,Adults’ Interpretation of Invitations Using the Word ‘Time’,"The present study examined adults' interpretations of invitations using the word ‘time’. Recent research has demonstrated that children may misunderstand these invitations as solely requesting temporal information (Friend et al., 2022). This study tested whether adults perceive the ambiguity in these invitations and whether they understand the source of children's pseudotemporal errors. We examined 401 adult participants' perceptions of invitations using the word ‘time’, varying the phrasing of the invitation (about the time vs. what happened) and whether the participant had exposure to a child's pseudotemporal response. Adults largely interpreted the invitations as requests for what happened during an event, not requests for when an event occurred. They rated the invitations as clear, not difficult and appropriate for elementary-aged children. However, they were more likely to rate about the time invitations as temporal compared to what happened invitations. Additionally, their perceptions of clarity and age appropriateness decreased when they were exposed to children's overtly pseudotemporal responses. These results suggest that although adults typically fail to identify the ambiguity in invitations using the word ‘time’, they are able to adjust their interpretation of the questions, at least when they are provided clear evidence of children's misinterpretation.",https://doi.org/10.1002/car.2869,2024,Child Abuse Review,33,3,,,,,,,

All children produced details in response to the like to do and yesterday narratives, compared to 98% of children in response to the birthday narrative. Questions about yesterday were more likely to elicit productive responses (93%) than questions about the child’s birthday (90%) or things they liked to do (88%). Older children produced the most details in response to questions about yesterday, and older children’s birthday narratives were more productive than those about favorite activities. Narratives about children’s birthday and yesterday produced comparable percentages of negative details (15%), whereas 32% of children mentioned something negative when discussing a favorite activity. The results suggest that although children find yesterday easier to recall than their last birthday, the birthday narrative is a productive tool for encouraging children to practice recalling more remote events, preparing them for abuse disclosures.",https://doi.org/10.1177/10775595241264279,2024,Child Maltreatment,N/A,N/A ,,,,,,,

Dianiska et al.,,Using Rapport Building to Improve Information Yield When Interviewing Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Call for Research,"Background Adolescents frequently experience and witness violence and crime, yet very little research has been conducted to determine how best to question these witnesses to elicit complete and accurate disclosures. Objective This systematic review integrated scientific research on rapport building with child and adult witnesses with theory and research on adolescent development in order to identify rapport building techniques likely to be effective with suspected adolescent victims and witnesses. Method. Four databases were searched to identify investigations of rapport building in forensic interviewing of adolescents. Results Despite decades of research of studies including child and adult participants, only one study since 1990 experimentally tested techniques to build rapport with adolescents. Most rapport strategies used with children and adults have yet to be tested with adolescents. Tests of these strategies, along with modifications based on developmental science of adolescence, would provide a roadmap to determining which approaches are most beneficial when questioning adolescent victims and witnesses. Conclusions There is a clear need for research that tests what strategies are best to use with adolescents. They may be reluctant to disclose information about stressful or traumatic experiences to adults due to both normative developmental processes and the types of events about which they are questioned in legal settings. Rapport building approaches tailored to address adolescents' motivational needs may be effective in increasing adolescents' reporting, and additional research testing such approaches will provide much-needed insight to inform the development of evidence-based practices for questioning these youth.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2024.106898,2024,Child Abuse & Neglect,,,,154,,,,,

Interviewers had been previously trained to engage children in narrative practice, maximize their use of invitations and directives, and minimize their use of option-posing questions. We examined the extent to which direct hands questions elicited novel information about force, duress, resistance, and the nature of touch and body mechanics. Fifty-nine percent of children’s responses to the direct hands questions elicited novel details. Age, child productivity, and time spent on narrative practice exhibited few relations with novelty. The number of prior invitations was consistently negatively related to novelty; when more invitations were asked, the hands questions were less likely to elicit novel information.

Participants viewed a series of child interview videos where children provided either a truthful report or a deceptive report to conceal a co-transgression; participants reported if they thought each child was lying or telling the truth. In Study 1 (N = 400), participants were assigned to one of the following conditions that varied in the type of interview shown and if context about the event in question was provided: full interview + context, recall questions + context, recognition questions + context, or full interview only (no context). Providing context (information about the potential co-transgression and coaching) significantly enhanced overall and lie accuracy, but this served the greatest benefit when provided with the recall interview, and participants held a lie bias. In Study 2 (N = 100), participants watched the full interview with simplified coaching information. Detection accuracy was reduced slightly but remained well above chance and the lie bias was eliminated. Thus, detection performance is improved when participants are given a child’s free-recall interview along with background information on the event and potential coaching, though providing specific coaching details introduces a lie bias.",https://doi.org/10.1080/1068316X.2024.2378058,2024,"Psychology, Crime & Law",,,,1,21,20,,,

In cases of substance use, a father has a drink, which, by itself, does not result in alcohol addiction. But he has another drink and another, until he develops an alcoholism that results in severe harm to his wife and children. Such cases present an interesting puzzle for thinking about moral responsibility because although long-term drinking caused harm to his family, the father likely never chose to drink long-term. Instead, typical drinkers are always making short-term decisions about alcohol consumption: whether one wants to have a beer now, whether one goes out with one’s buddies to the bar tonight, etc. That these individually harmless choices added up to a harmful long-term pattern of drinking was, in a sense, accidental.

We begin by outlining the nature of the academic gender gap and some of the obstacles to its removal or reduction, before considering the reasons this gap should be a matter for concern. Two kinds of reasons for such concern are offered: consequences-based and justice-based. The Foreword concludes by suggesting a number of ways in which the gender gap might be addressed, arguing for attention to be paid to the risk of pursuing apparent solutions which may have the effect of entrenching or exacerbating aspects of the problem. Ultimately, we argue that what is needed is not just a larger proportion of women in law schools, but a more just and feminist legal academy along multiple intersecting dimensions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/icon/moae010,2024,International Journal of Constitutional Law,22,1,,16,82,,,,

As that backdrop recedes into the past, it is being replaced by a more multi-polar and confusing world, and the current state of the discipline of comparative constitutionalism reflects this fragmentation and uncertainty. There is much to like about this state of affairs. It has opened up space for new, more varied, and increasingly critical voices seeking to improve the project of democratic constitutionalism. But it also raises questions: What of the past, if anything, is worth preserving? Which more recent parts should be defining of the field? In this context, this book asks which are—or should be—the canonical texts of comparative constitutionalism. The theoretical scope of the contributions is broad and ambitious, selecting primary material from beyond the existing textbooks to engage the concept of a canon. This framework provides significant insights about inclusion and exclusion, and proposes candidates for canonical and anti-canonical materials. The result is a wide-ranging discussion, among many voices, of how particular judgments and other primary texts have shaped or should shape our understanding of central elements of democratic constitutionalism from a comparative law perspective. This book offers not a prescription of one universal understanding, but a platform for a broader conversation about the field and the future of constitutional democracy.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381731566_The_Questions_of_Dignity,2024,Global Canons in an Age of Contestation: Debating Foundational Texts of Constitutional Democracy and Human Rights,,,,,,,,,
,yes,article,"Prieto Rudolphy, Marcela",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,,War and Coercion,"Compelled service in hostile forces is prohibited by International Humanitarian Law. In the context of an international armed conflict, it is a war crime to compel prisoners of war (“POWs”) or other protected persons to serve in the forces of a hostile power and to compel participation in military operations against the person’s own country or forces. However, conscription—or compelled service in military forces—of a state’s own citizens is not prohibited under international law. In fact, conscription, some aspects of which are regulated by International Human Rights Law, is generally legitimate. This asymmetry—whereby compelling protected persons to fight or serve in the forces of a hostile power is a war crime, but compelling one’s own citizens is not—has puzzling implications. Take the example of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is a war crime for Ukraine to compel Russian POWs to fight on behalf of Ukraine, even though Ukraine is fighting a lawful war of self-defense. Yet, it is not a war crime for Russia to compel its own citizens to fight, even though Russia is fighting an unlawful war of aggression. Can we make moral sense of this asymmetric regime regarding compelled service in armed forces? Is the regime morally coherent? In order to make moral sense of the regime, two arguments must succeed. First, we must argue that it matters greatly whether individuals are compelled to fight in hostile forces or in the armed forces of their own state. Second, we must argue that the nature of the war they are compelled to serve in—whether the war is legal or illegal—does not matter at all. This Article argues that the second argument cannot but fail, but it is possible to argue that compelled service in hostile forces is morally wrong and often morally worse than compelled service in the armed forces of one’s own state. It is morally worse because it is morally worse to harm those who are vulnerable and defenseless, like those who have fallen into the hands of a party to the conflict. And it is morally wrong because noncitizens lack duties to fight on behalf of other states. However, what makes compelled service in hostile forces morally wrong also makes conscription morally wrong. That is, what is wrong about compelled service in hostile forces is also present in the state’s conscription of its own citizens. This Article thus argues that the current regime concerning compelled service in armed forces is, in fact, morally incoherent. To render the regime morally coherent, international law should (1) appropriately distinguish between conscription to serve in legal wars and conscription to serve in illegal wars, and (2) generally prohibit compelled service in armed forces.",https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/2024/09/29/war-and-coercion/,2024,Southern California Law Review ,,,,,,,,,

On the Question of Co-Belligerency,"When does a state, by assisting one of the parties to an international armed conflict (IAC), become a party to it? Although the doctrinal answer to this question is somewhat unsettled, this chapter does not dispute or defend a specific doctrinal view. Instead, it explores the tension between philosophical accounts of the ethics of war and international humanitarian law (IHL), as it arises in the context of co-belligerency. After canvassing different doctrinal answers, the chapter discusses McMahan’s and similar revisionist views and to what extent they conflict with IHL’s positive answer to the question of co-belligerency. Then, the chapter argues that the ‘humanitarian view’ can partially solve this conflict, but it is still open to an important objection concerning IHL’s ability to reduce suffering, particularly in the long term. In order to dispel this objection in a morally attractive way, we have to concede that sometimes IHL reduces suffering at the expense of the rights of the innocent.

,yes,article,"McCaffery, Edward",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,,The Curiouser and Curiouser Case of Carried Interests,"In late July 2022, as the Inflation Reduction Act was being finalized, a provision limiting the carried interest preference, which allows billionaire hedge fund managers to qualify for the long-term capital gains rate on their highly lucrative “carry,” was scrapped. This continued a string of defeats for sensible policy reform dating back at least as far as Victor Fleischer’s Congressional testimony in 2007 and his seminal Two and Twenty law review article. The usual special interest view of politics took the blame for the inertia. In this Article, we explain how a “reverse Mancur Olson” or ex ante rent extraction model better explains what has – and has not – been going on. Lawmakers of both political parties have a financial interest in “stringing along” carried interest and similar issues, in order to extract rents in the form of campaign contributions. We illustrate how over the past fifteen years, Presidents and Congressional members of both parties have played this game, preserving the appearance of wanting to end the preference while maintaining the reality of doing nothing. The phenomenon not only makes sensible law reform difficult by keeping both rents and rent-extracting mechanisms in the law, but it also contributes to the overwhelming incumbency advantage that prevents more dynamic democratic turnover and change.",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4528472,2024,Arizona Law Review,66,2,,357,408,,,,
,yes,article,"Saks, Elyn ",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,,,Impact of Opera on Resilience and Thriving in Serious Mental Illness: Pilot Evaluation of The Center Cannot Hold Part 2 and Resilience Workshop,"There are few studies of impacts of arts on recovery in schizphrenia, on audience mood and social connection. We developed a pilot evaluation of opera performances in a university setting on Elyn Saks' journey from psychosis, teaching law and falling in love, coupled with pre-opera workshop on approaches to resilience. Using surveys, primary outcomes were pre and post affect (PANAS-X positive, negative; visual ""affect grid"" touchscreen for affective valence and arousal) and social connectedness with secondary outcomes of increasing understanding, reducing stigma and willingness to socialize or serve persons with mental illness. Of 107 live and 117 online attendees, 64 completed pre, 24 post, and 22 both surveys. Respondent characteristics were similar for those with pre and pre and post surveys: average age mid 50's, half female, 10% sexual minority, half White/Caucasian, 13% Hispanic/Latino, 11% Black/African American and 20% Asian; of 22 with pre and post, 9 (41%) were providers. There were significant post-pre increases in positive affect (PANAS-X) and arousal (visual grid) and social connectedness (Cohen's d = 0.82 to 1.24, each p < .001); and willingness to socialize with someone with schizophrenia (d = 0.68, p = .011). In this pilot evaluation of opera in a university auditorium, despite small sample sizes, there were significant post-pre increases in audience positive affect and social connection, which could reflect selection (those with positive response completing surveys) or may suggest that arts events promote well-being and connection, issues for future larger studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38517645/,2024,Community Mental Health Journal,60,5,,964,971,,,,

,yes,article,"Kleiman, Ariel Jurow",USC Gould School of Law,Law JD Operations,,"Ariel Jurow Kleiman, Shayak Sarkar & Emily Satterthwaite",,Taxing Nannies,"Nannies in the U.S. work long hours for low wages and risk retaliation if they complain. Informal, or “off the books,” work exacerbates their precarity, keeping it secret from state and federal tax agencies, as well as employment and labor agencies. Yet we have little understanding of how nannies navigate the tax reporting that renders them formal or informal. This Article investigates nannies’ preferences for or against formal employment and tax reporting, the reasons behind such preferences, and how such preferences inform nannies’ relationships with their employers and legal institutions more broadly. The Article employs a multi-method research approach that includes an original and innovative survey of nannies and an analysis of nannies’ tax-related posts on the online forum Reddit. To supplement this research, the Article also discusses interviews with fifteen subject-matter experts regarding industry norms, common challenges nannies face, and policy reforms. This multi-method approach reveals four key takeaways. First, surveyed nannies express a strong preference for and experience with formal employment. Second, however, a subset of nannies—often undocumented and working more informally—is missing from surveys and the literature. Extrapolating survey results to these most vulnerable populations may be unwise, but our expert interviews fill in these gaps. Third, the formal/informal dichotomy so prominent in the discourse is inaccurate. Rather, nanny pay arrangements exist across a spectrum, with some compensation both on and off the books to accommodate hirers’ and nannies’ complicated interests. As a consequence, the Article’s fourth takeaway is that simple calls for increased enforcement may not accomplish intended goals, given the heterogeneity of nannies’ tax lives. Instead, other legal institutions must first be reformed to better support vulnerable nannies and align incentives for formality across key systems such as tax, immigration, and public benefits.",https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/volume-110-issue-1/taxing-nannies,2024,Iowa Law Review,110,,,111,165,54,,,
