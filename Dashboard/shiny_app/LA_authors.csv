∼30 km east of downtown los angeles. we found that an average pavement albedo increase of 0.18 (from 0.08 to 0.26) corresponded to maximum neighborhood averaged t surface and t air reductions of 5 °c and 0.2 °c, respectively. maximum t surface reductions were observed in the afternoon, while minimum reductions of 0.9 °c were observed in the morning. t air reductions were detected at 12:00 local standard time (lst), and from 20:00 lst to 22:59 lst, suggesting that cool pavement decreases t air during the daytime as well as in the evening. an average albedo reduction of 30% corresponded to a ∼1 °c reduction in the t surface cooling efficacy. although we present here the first measured t air reductions due to cool pavement, we emphasize that the tradeoffs between t air reductions and reflected shortwave radiation increases are still unclear and warrant further investigation in order to holistically assess the efficacy of cool pavements, especially with regards to pedestrian thermal comfort.  © 2022 the author(s). published by iop publishing ltd. climate change;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

mean age: 11.1 ± 1.7 years; pre-pubertal/pubertal/post-pubertal: 85/101/17; bmi z-score: 2.1 ± 0.4). cumulative concentrations of no2, o3 and pm2.5 were spatially interpolated at the residential addresses based on measurements from community monitors up to 12 months prior to testing. single and multi-pollutant linear effects models were used to test the cumulative monthly lag effects of no2, o3, and pm2.5 on morning serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, sex, seasonality, social position, pubertal status, and body fat percent by dexa. results: single and multi-pollutant models showed that higher o3 exposure (derived from maximum 8-h exposure windows) in the prior 1–7 months was associated with higher serum morning cortisol (p < 0.05) and longer term pm2.5 exposure (4–10 months) was associated with lower serum morning cortisol levels (p < 0.05). stratification by pubertal status showed associations in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal and post-pubertal children. single, but not multi-pollutant, models showed that higher no2 over the 4–10 month exposure period associated with lower morning serum cortisol (p < 0.05). conclusions: chronic ambient no2, o3 and pm2.5 differentially associate with hpa-axis dysfunction, a mechanism that may serve as an explanatory pathway in the relationship between ambient air pollution and metabolic health of youth living in polluted urban environments. further research that uncovers how ambient air pollutants may differentially contribute to hpa-axis dysfunction are warranted. © 2021, the author(s). ambient air pollution;

however, in many parts of the world, communities experience water, sanitation, and hygiene (wash) insecurity. while wash insecurity is prevalent in many low and middle-income countries, it is also a problem in high-income countries, like the united states, as is evident in vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness. limited knowledge exists about the coping strategies unhoused people use to access wash services. this study, therefore, examines wash access among unhoused communities in los angeles, california, a city with the second-highest count of unhoused people across the nation. methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study using a snowball sampling technique with 263 unhoused people living in skid row, los angeles. we calculated frequencies and used multivariable models to describe (1) how unhoused communities cope and gain access to wash services in different places, and (2) what individual-level factors contribute to unhoused people’s ability to access wash services. results: our findings reveal that access to wash services for unhoused communities in los angeles is most difficult at night. reduced access to overnight sanitation resulted in 19% of the sample population using buckets inside their tents and 28% openly defecating in public spaces. bottled water and public taps are the primary drinking water source, but 6% of the sample reported obtaining water from fire hydrants, and 50% of the population stores water for night use. unhoused people also had limited access to water and soap for hand hygiene throughout the day, with 17% of the sample relying on hand sanitizer to clean their hands. shower and laundry access were among the most limited services available, and reduced people’s ability to maintain body hygiene practices and limited employment opportunities. our regression models suggest that wash access is not homogenous among the unhoused. community differences exist; the odds of having difficulty accessing sanitation services is two times greater for those living outside of skid row (adj or: 2.52; 95% ci: 1.08–6.37) and three times greater for people who have been unhoused for more than six years compared to people who have been unhoused for less than a year (adj or: 3.26; 95% ci: 1.36–8.07). conclusion: overall, this study suggests a need for more permanent, 24-h access to wash services for unhoused communities living in skid row, including toilets, drinking water, water and soap for hand hygiene, showers, and laundry services. © 2023, the author(s). access disparities;

poorer neurobehavioral development, but whether this association holds for us-based populations is unknown. objective: to examine associations of third trimester maternal urinary fluoride (muf) with child neurobehavior at age 3 years in the us. design, setting, and participants: this prospective cohort study utilized urine samples archived from 2017 to 2020 and neurobehavioral data assessed from 2020 to 2023 from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort, which consisted of predominately hispanic women residing in los angeles, california. cohort eligibility criteria at recruitment included being 18 years of age or older, less than 30 weeks' gestation, and a fluent english or spanish speaker. exclusion criteria included having a disability preventing participation or provision of informed consent, being hiv positive or incarcerated, and having a multiple gestation pregnancy. there were 263 mother-child pairs who completed the 3-year study visit. in this analysis, women who reported prenatal smoking were excluded. data analysis was conducted from october 2022 to march 2024. exposure: specific gravity-adjusted muf (mufsg), a biomarker of prenatal fluoride exposure. main outcomes and measures: neurobehavior was quantified using the preschool child behavior checklist (cbcl), which included composite scores for total problems, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. cbcl composite t scores range from 28 to 100. t scores from 60 to 63 are in the borderline clinical range, whereas scores above 63 are in the clinical range. linear and logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were conducted. results: a total of 229 mother-child pairs (mean [sd] maternal age, 29.45 [5.67] years; 116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; child behavior; child development; child, preschool; female; fluorides; humans; los angeles;

residents living near an urban oil drilling site in los angeles, california urban environmental justice communities are potentially exposed to multiple toxic metals, through contaminated air, soil, water, and food. however, information on metals and their sources is lacking. this study uses non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) in a community-based participatory research study to identify potential sources and to understand how these metals cluster in a population near an urban oil drilling site. we recruited 203 latinx, black, and asian residents who lived within 1 km of an oil drilling site in south los angeles and collected toenail clippings to assess exposure to arsenic (as), cadmium (cd), mercury (hg), manganese (mn), nickel (ni), lead (pb), and antimony (sb). using nmf, we identified three clusters based on concentrations in the participants' toenails. as, cd, pb, and sb grouped together, indicative of an industrial source. a second grouping was composed of ni and mn, which may be related to oil drilling. we also identified a third source factor predominantly driven by hg and as, which may arise from dietary sources. utilizing nmf, a dimension reduction method, we identified a source factor high in ni and mn in residents living in a neighborhood near an active oil drilling site. © 2022 american chemical society. all rights reserved. biomarker; environmental

pre-natal periods in which ambient air pollution exposure affects fetal growth in the predominately hispanic madres cohort background: it is well documented that persons of color experience disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants, including air pollution, and have poorer pregnancy outcomes. this study assessed the critical windows of exposure to ambient air pollution on in utero fetal growth among structurally marginalized populations in urban los angeles. methods: participants (n = 281) from the larger ongoing madres pregnancy cohort study were included in this analysis. fetal growth outcomes were measured on average at 32 ± 2 weeks of gestation by a certified sonographer and included estimated fetal weight, abdominal circumference, head circumference, biparietal diameter and femur length. daily ambient air pollutant concentrations were estimated for four pollutants (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (pm2.5) and less than 10 µm (pm10) in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-h maximum ozone (o3)) at participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. weekly gestational averages were calculated from 12 weeks prior to conception to 32 weeks of gestation (44 total weeks), and their associations with growth outcomes were modeled using adjusted distributed lag models (dlms). results: participants were on average 29 years ± 6 old and predominately hispanic (82%). we identified a significant sensitive window of pm2.5 exposure (per iqr increase of 6 μg / m 3) between gestational weeks 4–16 for lower estimated fetal weight βaveraged4-16 = -8.7 g; 95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution; dlm; fetal growth; health disparities; particulate matter;

background: fluoride is ubiquitous in the united states (us); however, data on biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among us pregnant women are scarce. we examined specific gravity adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (mufsg) in relation to sociodemographic variables and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california. methods: participants were from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort. there were 293 and 490 women with mufsg measured during first and third trimesters, respectively. an intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of mufsg between trimesters. kruskal–wallis and mann-whitney u tests examined associations of mufsg with sociodemographic variables. covariate adjusted linear regression examined associations of mufsg with blood metals and specific gravity adjusted urine metals among a subsample of participants within and between trimesters. a false discovery rate (fdr) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. results: median (iqr) mufsg was 0.65 (0.5) mg/l and 0.8 (0.59) mg/l, during trimesters one and three respectively. during both trimesters, mufsg was higher among older participants, those with higher income, and white, non-hispanic participants than hispanic participants. mufsg was also higher for white, non-hispanic participants than for black, non-hispanic participants in trimester three, and for those with graduate training in trimester one. mufsg was negatively associated with blood mercury in trimester one and positively associated with blood lead in trimester three. mufsg was positively associated with various urinary metals, including antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc in trimesters one and/or three. conclusions: mufsg levels observed were comparable to those found in pregnant women in mexico and canada that have been associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. lower urinary fluoride levels among hispanic and non-hispanic black participants in madres compared to non-hispanic white participants may reflect lower tap water consumption or lower fluoride exposure from other sources. additional research is needed to examine whether mufsg levels observed among pregnant women in the us are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2023, biomed

pregnancy is increasingly recognized as a vulnerable window for exposure effects on maternal mental health. exposures to organophosphate esters (opes) are ubiquitous and may have neurotoxic effects; however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression; mixtures analysis;

important environmental risk for maternal and children's health, with peak exposures especially those derived from primary combustion hypothesized to pose greater risk. identifying pm2.5 peaks and their contributions to personal exposure remains challenging. this study measured personal pm2.5 exposure, characterized primary combustion peaks, and investigated their determinants during and after pregnancy and among hispanic women in los angeles, ca. methods: continuous personal pm2.5 exposure, global positioning system geolocation, and ecological momentary assessment surveys were collected from 63 women for 4 consecutive days in their 1st trimester, 3rd trimester and 4–6 months postpartum. based on the shape of pm2.5 time-series, primary combustion peaks were identified, characterized (number, duration, area under the curve [auc]), and linked with locations they occurred in. zero-inflated generalized mixed-effect models were used to examine the spatial and temporal determinants of pm2.5 peak exposures. results: a total of 490 pm2.5 peaks were identified from 618 person-days of monitoring. spending an additional minute at parks and open spaces was related to smaller (auc decreased 3.1 %, 95 % ci: 1.5 %–4.6 %) and shorter (duration decreased 1.7 %, 0.5 %–2.9 %) pm2.5 peak exposure. an additional minute in vehicular trips also related to smaller and shorter peak exposure (auc and duration decreased 2.5 %, 1.2 %–3.7 % and 1.8 %, 1.0 %–2.6 %, respectively). however, an additional minute at industrial locations was associated with greater number (3.6 %, 2.0 %–5.2 %), auc (1.6 %, 0.1 %–3.2 %) and duration (1.0 %, 0.0 %–2.1 %) of personal pm2.5 peak exposure. conclusions: this study demonstrates the potential to statistically identify exposure to primary combustion pm2.5 peaks and understand their determinants from personal monitoring data. results suggest that visits to parks and open spaces may minimize pm2.5 peak exposures, while visiting industrial locations may increase them in and around pregnancy. © 2024 fine particulate matter; microenvironment; peak exposures; personal exposure; primary combustion; time-activity ;demographic predictors of urinary arsenic in a low-income predominantly hispanic pregnancy cohort in los angeles background: arsenic (as) is a contaminant of top public health concern, due to its range of detrimental health effects. arsenic exposure has not been well-characterized among the us hispanic populations and has been particularly understudied in this population during pregnancy. methods: as part of the madres ongoing pregnancy cohort of predominantly lower-income, hispanic women in los angeles, ca, we examined levels of maternal first trimester urinary as, including total as and as metabolites (inorganic (ias), monomethylated (mma) and dimethylated as (dma)), in relation to participant demographics, lifestyle characteristics, and rice/seafood consumption, to identify factors that may influence as exposure and its metabolites during pregnancy (n = 241). results: total as concentrations ranged from low to high (0.8–506.2 μg/l, mean: 9.0 μg/l, sd: 32.9) in our study population. foreign-born hispanic women had 8.6% higher %dma (95% ci: 3.3%, 13.9%) and −7.7% lower %ias (95% ci: −12.6%, −2.9%) than non-hispanic women. a similar trend was observed for us-born hispanic women. in addition, maternal age was associated with 0.4% higher %ias (95% ci: 0.1%, 0.6%) and 0.4% lower %dma (95% ci: −0.7%, −0.1%) per year, which may indicate poor as methylation capacity. conclusion: individual factors may predict as exposure and metabolism in pregnancy, and in turn, greater risk of adverse health effects. © 2020, the author(s), under exclusive licence to

pollution is a hazardous contaminant, exposure to which has substantial consequences for health during critical periods, such as pregnancy. microrna (mirna) is an epigenetic mechanism that modulates transcriptome responses to the environment and has been found to change in reaction to air pollution exposure. the data are limited regarding extracellular-vesicle (ev) mirna variation associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy and in susceptible populations who may be disproportionately exposed. this study aimed to identify ev-mirna expression associated with ambient, residential exposure to pm2.5, pm10, no2, o3 and with traffic-related nox in 461 participants of the madres cohort, a low income, predominantly hispanic pregnancy cohort based in los angeles, ca. this study used residence-based modeled air pollution data as well as nanostring panels for evmirna extracted with qiagen exorneasy kits to evaluate 483 mirna in plasma in early and late pregnancy. average air pollution exposures were considered separately for 1-day, 1-week, and 8-week windows before blood collection in both early and late pregnancy. this study identified 63 and 66 evmirna significantly associated with pm2.5 and pm10, respectively, and 2 mirna associated with traffic-related nox (false discovery rate-adjusted p-value < .05). of 103 unique ev-mirna associated with pm, 92% were associated with lung conditions according to hmdd (human mirna disease database) evidence. in particular, ev-mirna previously identified with air pollution exposure also associated with pm2.5 and pm10 in this study were: mir-126, mir-16-5p, mir-187-3p, mir200b-3p, mir486-3p, and mir-582-3p. there were no significant differences in average exposures in early vs late pregnancy. significant ev-mirnas were only identified in late pregnancy with an 8-week exposure window, suggesting a vulnerable timeframe of exposure, rather than an acute response. these results describe a wide array of ev-mirna for which expression is affected by pm exposure and may be in part mediating the biological response to ambient air pollution, with potential for health implications in pregnant women and their children.

different sources each with different chemical composition. determining these sources is important for reducing personal exposure and its health risks especially during pregnancy. objective: identify main sources and their contributions to the personal pm2.5 exposure in 213 women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in los angeles, ca. methods: we measured 48-hr integrated personal pm2.5 exposure and analyzed filters for pm2.5 mass, elemental composition, and optical carbon fractions. we used the epa positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to resolve and quantify the major sources of personal pm2.5 exposure. we then investigated bivariate relationships between sources, time-activity patterns, and environmental exposures in activity spaces and residential neighborhoods to further understand sources. results: mean personal pm2.5 mass concentration was 22.3 (sd = 16.6) μg/m3. twenty-five species and pm2.5 mass were used in pmf with a final r2 of 0.48. we identified six sources (with major species in profiles and % contribution to pm2.5 mass) as follows: secondhand smoking (shs) (brown carbon, environmental tobacco smoke; 65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure; pm<sub>2.5</sub>; pregnancy; secondhand smoking source; source apportionment; traffic source adult; air pollutants; air

both toxic and essential metals which influence fetal growth. however, most studies have conducted single-cohort analyses, which are often limited by narrow exposure ranges, and evaluated metals individually. the objective of the current study was to conduct an environmental mixture analysis of metal impacts on fetal growth, pooling data from three geographically and demographically diverse cohorts in the united states participating in the environmental influences on child health outcomes program. methods: the pooled sample (n = 1,002) included participants from the madres, nhbcs, and protect cohorts. associations between seven metals (antimony, cadmium, cobalt, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, tin) measured in maternal urine samples collected during pregnancy (median: 16.0 weeks gestation) and birth weight for gestational age z-scores (bw for ga) were investigated using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). models were also stratified by cohort and infant sex to investigate possible heterogeneity. chromium and uranium concentrations fell below the limits of detection for most participants and were evaluated separately as binary variables using pooled linear regression models. results: in the pooled bkmr analysis, antimony, mercury, and tin were inversely and linearly associated with bw for ga, while a positive linear association was identified for nickel. the inverse association between antimony and bw for ga was observed in both males and females and for all three cohorts but was strongest for madres, a predominantly low-income hispanic cohort in los angeles. a reverse j-shaped association was identified between cobalt and bw for ga, which was driven by female infants. pooled associations were null for cadmium, chromium, molybdenum, and uranium, and bkmr did not identify potential interactions between metal pairs. conclusions: findings suggest that antimony, an understudied metalloid, may adversely impact fetal growth. cohort- and/or sex-dependent associations were identified for many of the metals, which merit additional investigation. © 2022 bkmr; fetal growth; metalloids; metals; mixtures; pooled analysis bayes theorem; birth

children residing in communities near metalworking industries are vulnerable to multiple toxic metal exposures. understanding biomarkers of exposure to multiple toxic metals is important to characterize cumulative burden and to distinguish potential exposure sources in such environmental justice neighborhoods impacted by industrial operations. exposure to metal mixtures has not been well-characterized among children residing in the united states, and is understudied in communities of color. methods: in this study we used toenail clippings, a noninvasive biomarker, to assess exposure to arsenic (as), cadmium (cd), mercury (hg), manganese (mn), lead (pb), antimony (sb), selenium (se), and vanadium (v). we used nonnegative matrix factorization (nmf) to identify “source” signatures and patterns of exposure among predominantly working class latinx children residing near an industrial corridor in southeast los angeles county. additionally, we investigated the association between participant demographic, spatial, and dietary characteristics with identified metal signatures. results: through nmf, we identified three groupings (source factors) for the metal concentrations in children’s toenails. a grouping composed of sb, pb, as, and cd, was identified as a potential industrial source factor, reflective of known airborne elemental emissions in the industrial corridor. we further identified a manganese source factor primarily composed of mn, and a potential dietary source factor driven by se and hg. we observed differences in the industrial source factor by age of participants, while the dietary source factor varied by neighborhood. conclusion: utilizing an unsupervised dimension reduction technique (nmf), we identified a “source signature” of contamination in toenail samples from children living near metalworking industry. investigating patterns and sources of exposures in cumulatively burdened communities is necessary to identify appropriate public health interventions. © 2021, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature america, inc. biomonitoring; children’s health; environmental justice;

been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). we aim to investigate susceptible windows of air pollution exposure and factors determining population vulnerability. methods: we ascertained gdm status in the prospective maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort from los angeles, california, usa. we calculated the relative risk of gdm by exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm10; pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air

between ambient air pollution and birth weight by maternal individual- and neighborhood-level stressors importance: fetal growth is precisely programmed and could be interrupted by environmental exposures during specific times during pregnancy. insights on potential sensitive windows of air pollution exposure in association with birth weight are needed. objective: to examine the association of sensitive windows of ambient air pollution exposure with birth weight and heterogeneity by individual- and neighborhood-level stressors. design, setting, and participants: data on a cohort of low-income hispanic women with singleton term pregnancy were collected from 2015 to 2021 in the ongoing maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors cohort in los angeles, california. exposures: daily ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (pm10) and aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-hour maximum ozone were assigned to residential locations. weekly averages from 12 weeks before conception to 36 gestational weeks were calculated. individual-level psychological stressor was measured by the perceived stress scale. neighborhood-level stressor was measured by the calenviroscreen 4.0. main outcomes and measures: sex-specific birth weight for gestational age z score (bwz). the associations between air pollutant and bwz were estimated using distributed lag models to identify sensitive windows of exposure, adjusting for maternal and meteorologic factors. we stratified the analyses by perceived stress scale and calenviroscreen 4.0. we converted the effect size estimation in bwz to grams to facilitate interpretation. results: the study included 628 pregnant women (mean [sd] age, 22.18 [5.92] years) and their newborns (mean [sd] bwz, -0.08 [1.03]). on average, an interquartile range (iqr) increase in pm2.5exposure during 4 to 22 gestational weeks was associated with a -9.5 g (95% ci, -10.4 to -8.6 g) change in birth weight. in stratified models, pm2.5from 4 to 24 gestational weeks was associated with a -34.0 g (95% ci, -35.7 to -32.4 g) change in birth weight and pm10from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -39.4 g (95% ci, -45.4 to -33.4) change in birth weight in the subgroup with high perceived stress scale and high calenviroscreen 4.0 scores. in this same group, no2from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -40.4 g (95% ci, -47.4 to -33.3 g) change in birth weight and, from 33 to 36 gestational weeks, a -117.6 g (95% ci, -125.3 to -83.7 g) change in birth weight. generally, there were no significant preconception windows for any air pollutants or ozone exposure with birth weight. conclusions and relevance: in this cohort study, early pregnancy to midpregnancy exposures to pm2.5, pm10, and no2were associated with lower birth weight, particularly for mothers experiencing higher perceived stress and living in a neighborhood with a high level of stressors from environmental pollution. © 2022 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; air pollutants; air pollution; birth weight; cohort studies; female; humans;

cohort study background: prenatal air pollution exposure may increase risk for childhood obesity. however, few studies have evaluated in utero growth measures and infant weight trajectories. this study will evaluate the associations of prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants with weight trajectories from the 3rd trimester through age 2 years. methods: we studied 490 pregnant women who were recruited from the maternal and development risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, which comprises a low-income, primarily hispanic population in los angeles, california. nitrogen dioxide (no2), particulate matter < 10 µm (pm10), particulate matter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), and ozone (o3) concentrations during pregnancy were estimated from regulatory air monitoring stations. fetal weight was estimated from maternal ultrasound records. infant/child weight measurements were extracted from medical records or measured during follow-up visits. piecewise spline models were used to assess the effect of air pollutants on weight, overall growth, and growth during each period. results: the mean (sd) prenatal exposure concentrations for no2, pm2.5, pm10, and o3 were 16.4 (2.9) ppb, 12.0 (1.1) μg/m3, 28.5 (4.7) μg/m3, and 26.2 (2.9) ppb, respectively. comparing an increase in prenatal average air pollutants from the 10th to the 90th percentile, the growth rate from the 3rd trimester to age 3 months was significantly increased (1.55% [95%ci 1.20%, 1.99%] for pm2.5 and 1.64% [95%ci 1.27%, 2.13%] for no2), the growth rate from age 6 months to age 2 years was significantly decreased (0.90% [95%ci 0.82%, 1.00%] for no2), and the attained weight at age 2 years was significantly lower (− 7.50% [95% ci − 13.57%, − 1.02%] for pm10 and − 7.00% [95% ci − 11.86%, − 1.88%] for no2). conclusions: prenatal ambient air pollution was associated with variable changes in growth rate and attained weight from the 3rd trimester to age 2 years. these results suggest continued public health benefits of reducing ambient air pollution levels, particularly in marginalized populations. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer nature. in utero growth; infant weight trajectory;

cause of mental health-related morbidity and affects twice as many women as men. hispanic/latina women in the us have unique risk factors for depression and they have lower utilization of mental health care services. identifying modifiable risk factors for maternal depression, such as ambient air pollution, is an urgent public health priority. we aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants was associated with maternal depression at 12 months after childbirth. methods: one hundred eighty predominantly low-income hispanic/latina women participating in the ongoing madres cohort study in los angeles, ca were followed from early pregnancy through 12 months postpartum through a series of phone questionnaires and in-person study visits. daily prenatal ambient pollutant estimates of nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and particulate matter (pm10 and pm2.5) were assigned to participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. exposures were averaged for each trimester and across pregnancy. the primary outcome measure was maternal depression at 12 months postpartum, as reported on the 20-item center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale. we classified each participant as depressed (n = 29) or not depressed (n = 151) based on the suggested cutoff of 16 or above (possible scores range from 0 to 60) and fitted logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. results: we found over a two-fold increased odds of depression at 12 months postpartum associated with second trimester no2 exposure (or = 2.63, 95% ci: 1.41–4.89) and pregnancy average no2 (or = 2.04, 95% ci: 1.13–3.69). higher second trimester pm2.5 exposure also was associated with increased depression at 12 months postpartum (or = 1.56, 95% ci: 1.01–2.42). the effect for second trimester pm10 was similar and was borderline significant (or = 1.58, 95% ci: 0.97–2.56). conclusions: in a low-income cohort consisting of primarily hispanic/latina women in urban los angeles, we found that prenatal ambient air pollution, especially mid-pregnancy no2 and pm2.5, increased the risk of depression at 12 months after childbirth. these results underscore the need to better understand the contribution of modifiable environmental risk factors during potentially critical exposure periods. © 2021, the author(s).

prenatal depression background: air pollution has been associated with gestational hypertension (gh) and preeclampsia, but susceptible windows of exposure and potential vulnerability by comorbidities, such as prenatal depression, remain unclear. methods: we ascertained gh and preeclampsia cases in a prospective pregnancy cohort in los angeles, ca daily levels of ambient particulate matters (with a diameter of ≤10 μm [pm10] or ≤2.5 μm [pm2.5]), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone were averaged for each week from 12 weeks preconception to 20 gestational weeks. we used distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows, adjusting for potential confounders. analyses were additionally stratified by probable prenatal depression to explore population vulnerability. results: among 619 participants, 60 developed preeclampsia and 42 developed gh. we identified a susceptible window for exposure to pm2.5from 1 week preconception to 11 weeks postconception: higher exposure (5 μg/m3) within this window was associated with an average of 8% (95% ci, 1%-15%) higher risk of gh. among participants with probable prenatal depression (n=179; 32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution; depression; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; preeclampsia; pregnancy complications adult; air pollutants;

although ~18 million people live within a mile from active oil and gas development (ogd) sites in the united states, epidemiological research on how ogd affects the health of nearby urban residents is sparse. thousands of ogd sites are spread across los angeles (la) county, california, home to the largest urban oil production in the country. air pollution and noise from ogd may contribute to cardiovascular morbidity. objective: we examined the association between proximity to ogd and blood pressure in a diverse cohort of residents in la. methods: we recruited residents in south la who lived <1 km from an ogd site. we collected three blood pressure measurements for each participant and used the second and third measurements to calculate averages for systolic blood pressure (sbp) and diastolic blood pressure (dbp) separately. we conducted multivariable linear regression to examine the relationship between distance to ogd sites and continuous sbp and dbp, adjusting for bmi, smoking status, distance to freeway, sex, age, and use of antihypertension medications, with a random effect for household. we examined effect measure modification by bmi category and smoking category. results: among the 623 adult participants, we found that for every 100 meter increase in distance from the ogd site, dbp was reduced by an average of 0.73 mmhg (95% ci: −1.26, −0.21) in this population. we observed stronger effects of proximity to ogd site on dbp among never smokers and among participants with a healthy bmi. the associations observed between proximity to ogd site and sbp were weaker but followed the same patterns as those for dbp. impact: our study suggests that living near urban oil drilling sites is significantly associated with greater diastolic blood pressure in urban los angeles communities. this research improves understanding of impacts from living nearby drilling operations on the health and welfare of this community, which is critical to inform public health relevant strategies. © 2023, the author(s). blood pressure; cardiovascular; environmental justice; oil and gas "

however, in many parts of the world, communities experience water, sanitation, and hygiene (wash) insecurity. while wash insecurity is prevalent in many low and middle-income countries, it is also a problem in high-income countries, like the united states, as is evident in vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness. limited knowledge exists about the coping strategies unhoused people use to access wash services. this study, therefore, examines wash access among unhoused communities in los angeles, california, a city with the second-highest count of unhoused people across the nation. methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study using a snowball sampling technique with 263 unhoused people living in skid row, los angeles. we calculated frequencies and used multivariable models to describe (1) how unhoused communities cope and gain access to wash services in different places, and (2) what individual-level factors contribute to unhoused people’s ability to access wash services. results: our findings reveal that access to wash services for unhoused communities in los angeles is most difficult at night. reduced access to overnight sanitation resulted in 19% of the sample population using buckets inside their tents and 28% openly defecating in public spaces. bottled water and public taps are the primary drinking water source, but 6% of the sample reported obtaining water from fire hydrants, and 50% of the population stores water for night use. unhoused people also had limited access to water and soap for hand hygiene throughout the day, with 17% of the sample relying on hand sanitizer to clean their hands. shower and laundry access were among the most limited services available, and reduced people’s ability to maintain body hygiene practices and limited employment opportunities. our regression models suggest that wash access is not homogenous among the unhoused. community differences exist; the odds of having difficulty accessing sanitation services is two times greater for those living outside of skid row (adj or: 2.52; 95% ci: 1.08–6.37) and three times greater for people who have been unhoused for more than six years compared to people who have been unhoused for less than a year (adj or: 3.26; 95% ci: 1.36–8.07). conclusion: overall, this study suggests a need for more permanent, 24-h access to wash services for unhoused communities living in skid row, including toilets, drinking water, water and soap for hand hygiene, showers, and laundry services. © 2023, the author(s). access disparities;

mean age: 11.1 ± 1.7 years; pre-pubertal/pubertal/post-pubertal: 85/101/17; bmi z-score: 2.1 ± 0.4). cumulative concentrations of no2, o3 and pm2.5 were spatially interpolated at the residential addresses based on measurements from community monitors up to 12 months prior to testing. single and multi-pollutant linear effects models were used to test the cumulative monthly lag effects of no2, o3, and pm2.5 on morning serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, sex, seasonality, social position, pubertal status, and body fat percent by dexa. results: single and multi-pollutant models showed that higher o3 exposure (derived from maximum 8-h exposure windows) in the prior 1–7 months was associated with higher serum morning cortisol (p < 0.05) and longer term pm2.5 exposure (4–10 months) was associated with lower serum morning cortisol levels (p < 0.05). stratification by pubertal status showed associations in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal and post-pubertal children. single, but not multi-pollutant, models showed that higher no2 over the 4–10 month exposure period associated with lower morning serum cortisol (p < 0.05). conclusions: chronic ambient no2, o3 and pm2.5 differentially associate with hpa-axis dysfunction, a mechanism that may serve as an explanatory pathway in the relationship between ambient air pollution and metabolic health of youth living in polluted urban environments. further research that uncovers how ambient air pollutants may differentially contribute to hpa-axis dysfunction are warranted. © 2021, the author(s). ambient air pollution;

regulations this study aimed to investigate the long-term variations in the contributions of emission sources to ambient pm 2.5 organic carbon (oc) in central los angeles (cela) and riverside using the chemical speciation network (csn) database in the 2005-2015 period, during which several federal and state pm-based regulations were implemented to reduce tailpipe emissions in the region. the measured concentrations of oc, oc volatility fractions (i.e., oc1, oc2, and oc3), elemental carbon (ec), ozone (o3), sulfate, the ratio of potassium ion to potassium (k+/k), and selected metal elements were used as the input to the positive matrix factorization (pmf) model. pmf resolved tailpipe emissions, non-tailpipe emissions, secondary organic aerosols (soa), biomass burning, and local industrial activities as the main sources contributing to ambient oc at both sampling sites. vehicular exhaust emissions, non-tailpipe emissions, and soa were dominant sources of oc across our sampling sites, accounting cumulatively for more than 80% of total oc mass throughout the study period. our findings showed a significant reduction in the absolute and relative contributions of tailpipe emissions to the ambient oc levels in cela and riverside over the time period of 2005-2015. the contribution of exhaust emissions to total oc in cela decreased from 3.5 g m-3 (49%) in 2005 to 1.5 g m-3 (34%) in 2015, while similar trends were observed at riverside during this period. these reductions are mainly attributed to the implementation of several federal, state, and local air quality regulations targeting tailpipe emissions in the area. the implementation of these regulations furthermore reduced the emissions of primary organic precursors of secondary aerosols, resulting in an overall decrease (although not statistically significant, p values ranging from 0.4 to 0.6) in soa mass concentration in both locations over the study period. in contrast to the tailpipe emissions, we observed an increasing trend (by ∼4 to 14%) in the relative contribution of non-tailpipe emissions to oc over this time period at both sites. our results demonstrated the effectiveness of air quality regulations in reducing direct tailpipe emissions in the area, but also underpinned the need to develop equally effective mitigation policies targeting non-tailpipe pm emissions. this

emissions;evaluation of a high flow rate electrostatic precipitator (esp) as a particulate matter (pm) collector for toxicity studies in this study, we investigated the performance of an electrostatic precipitator (esp) operating at high flow rates (i.e., 50–100 lpm) as a fine particulate matter (pm2.5) collector for toxicological studies. the esp optimum configuration (i.e., flow rate of 75 lpm and applied voltage of +12 kv) was determined based on maximum particle collection efficiencies and minimum ozone emissions associated with the instrument using different laboratory-generated aerosols. this configuration resulted in particle collection efficiencies above 80% for almost all particles in the size range of 0.015–2.5 μm while the ozone concentration was 17 ppb. the esp was then deployed to our sampling site in central los angeles to evaluate its performance using ambient particles under the optimum configuration. chemical composition and oxidative potential of pm2.5 samples collected on the foils placed inside the esp tube were compared with those collected concurrently on filters and aerosol slurries using the versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (vaces) operating in parallel. our results demonstrated that the esp was more efficient in preserving labile inorganic ions and total organic carbon (toc) compared to filters. pm samples collected on esp substrates also showed higher intrinsic oxidative potential compared to the filters, which might be the result of better preservation of redox active semi-volatile organic compounds on the esp substrates. however, the toc concentrations and intrinsic oxidative potential of pm samples collected on esp substrates were somewhat lower than the aerosol slurries collected by the vaces, probably due to deficiency of water-insoluble compounds in extracted pm samples from esp substrates. in conclusion, while particle collection for toxicological purposes by the esp is somewhat inferior to a direct aerosol-into-liquid collection, the esp performs equally well, if not better, than conventional filter samplers and can be utilized as a simple and adequately efficient pm collector for toxicological studies. © 2020 elsevier b.v. aerosol-into-liquid collection; electrostatic precipitator (esp); oxidative potential; pm collector; vaces aerosols; air pollutants; los angeles; particle

particulate matter (pm2.5) from urban los angeles using spectro-microscopy methods the speciation, oxidation states, and relative abundance of iron (fe) phases in pm2.5 samples from two locations in urban los angeles were investigated using a combination of bulk and spatially resolved, element-specific spectroscopy and microscopy methods. synchrotron x-ray absorption spectroscopy (xas) of bulk samples in situ (i.e., without extraction or digestion) was used to quantify the relative fractions of major fe phases, which were corroborated by spatially resolved spectro-microscopy measurements. ferrihydrite (amorphous fe(iii)-hydroxide) comprised the largest fe fraction (34–52%), with hematite (α-fe2o3; 13–23%) and magnetite (fe3o4; 10–24%) identified as major crystalline oxide components. an fe-bearing phyllosilicate fraction (16–23%) was fit best with a reference spectrum of a natural illite/smectite mineral, and metallic fe(0) was a relatively small (2–6%) but easily identified component. sizes, morphologies, oxidation state, and trace element compositions of fe-bearing pm from electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy (eels), and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (stxm) revealed variable and heterogeneous mixtures of fe species and phases, often associated with carbonaceous material with evidence of surface oxidation. ferrihydrite (or related fe(iii) hydroxide phases) was ubiquitous in pm samples. it forms as an oxidation or surface alteration product of crystalline fe phases, and also occurs as coatings or nanoparticles dispersed with other phases as a result of environmental dissolution and re-precipitation reactions. the prevalence of ferrihydrite (and adsorbed fe(iii)) has likely been underestimated in studies of ambient pm because it is non-crystalline, non-magnetic, more soluble than crystalline phases, and found in complex mixtures. review of potential sources of different particle types suggests that the majority of fe-bearing pm from these urban sites originates from anthropogenic activities, primarily abrasion products from vehicle braking systems and engine emissions from combustion and/or wear. these variable mixtures have a high probability for electron transfer reactions between fe, redox-active metals such as copper, and reactive carbon species such as quinones. our findings suggest the need to assess biological responses of specific fe-bearing phases both individually and in combination to unravel mechanisms of adverse health effects of particulate fe. © 2020 6): pm<sub>2.5</sub>; electron energy

nanoparticles from los angeles: recently decreased neurotoxicity background: air pollution is widely associated with accelerated cognitive decline at later ages and risk of alzheimer's disease (ad). correspondingly, rodent models demonstrate the neurotoxicity of ambient air pollution and its components. our studies with nano-sized particulate matter (npm) from urban los angeles collected since 2009 have shown pro-amyloidogenic and pro-inflammatory responses. however, recent batches of npm have diminished induction of the glutamate receptor glua1 subunit, iba1, tnfα, aβ42 peptide, and white matter damage. the same methods, materials, and mouse genotypes were used throughout. objective: expand the npm batch comparisons and evaluate archived brain samples to identify the earliest change in npm potency. methods: batches of npm were analyzed by in vitro cell assays for nf-κb and nrf2 induction for comparison with in vivo responses of mouse brain regions from mice exposed to these batches, analyzed by pcr and western blot. results: five older npm batches (2009-2017) and four recent npm batches (2018, 2019) for nf-κb and nrf2 induction showed declines in npm potency after 2017 that paralleled declines of in vivo activity from independent exposures in different years. conclusion: transcription-based in vitro assays of npm corresponded to the loss of in vivo potency for inflammatory and oxidative responses. these recent decreases of npm neurotoxicity give a rationale for evaluating possible benefits to the risk of dementia and stroke in los angeles populations.  ©

lung cancer in southern california rationale: particulate matter <2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (pm2.5) is an established cause of lung cancer, but the association with ultrafine particulate matter (ufp; aerodynamic diameter, 0.1 μm) is unclear. objectives: to investigate the association between ufp and lung cancer overall and by histologic subtype. methods: the los angeles ultrafines study includes 45,012 participants aged >50 years in southern california at enrollment (1995–1996) followed through 2017 for incident lung cancer (n = 1,770). we estimated historical residential ambient ufp number concentrations via land use regression and back extrapolation using pm2.5. in cox proportional hazards models adjusted for smoking and other confounders, we estimated associations between 10-year lagged ufp (per 10,000 particles/cm3 and quartiles) and lung cancer overall and by major histologic subtype (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma). we also evaluated relationships by smoking status, birth cohort, and historical duration at the residence. measurements and main results: ufp was modestly associated with lung cancer risk overall (hazard ratio [hr], 1.03 [95% confidence interval (ci), 0.99–1.08]). for adenocarcinoma, we observed a positive trend among men; risk was increased in the highest exposure quartile versus the lowest (hr, 1.39 [95% ci, 1.05–1.85]; p for trend = 0.01) and was also increased in continuous models (hr per 10,000 particles/cm3, 1.09 [95% ci, 1.00–1.18]), but no increased risk was apparent among women (p for interaction = 0.03). adenocarcinoma risk was elevated among men born between 1925 and 1930 (hr, 1.13 [95% ci, 1.02–1.26] per 10,000) but not for other birth cohorts, and was suggestive for men with >10 years of residential duration (hr, 1.11 [95% ci, 0.98–1.26]). we found no consistent associations for women or other histologic subtypes. conclusions: ufp exposure was modestly associated with lung cancer overall, with stronger associations observed for adenocarcinoma of the lung. © 2024 by the american thoracic society. air pollution; lung neoplasms; particulate matter adenocarcinoma;

factorization of ultrafine particle mass (pm0.1) at three sites in california ultrafine particles (ufps) are an emerging air quality concern because of their enhanced toxicity compared to larger airborne particles. this study aims to better understand source contributions to ufp mass (pm0.1) at multiples sites across california. three-day average samples of pm0.1 collected over a full year at san pablo, east oakland, and los angeles were analyzed using positive matrix factorization (pmf). seven pm0.1 source-factors were identified at all locations: factor1- gasoline+motor oil+meat cooking+natural gas+soa (31–53% pm0.1 mass), factor 2- diesel+motor oil (25–45% pm0.1 mass), factor 3-wood burning (6–12% pm0.1 mass), factor 4-shipping and other heavy fuel oil combustion (2–3% pm0.1 mass), factor 5-sea spray (4–8% pm0.1 mass), factor 6-sb brake wear (1–3% pm0.1 mass) and factor 7-sn - unknown (1–7% pm0.1 mass). pm0.1 wood burning contributions were highest in the winter season when residential wood combustion was active. the monthly-averaged pm0.1 source apportionment results calculated by pmf are consistent with the pm0.1 source apportionment results calculated using chemical mass balance (cmb) from the same sampling campaign. pmf distinguished diesel+motor oil from gasoline+motor oil+meat cooking+natural gas+soa based on the species ec3 (a sub-fraction of elemental carbon that is volatilized and oxidized at temperatures between 700 and 775 °c), but pmf failed to further resolve the major sources of pm0.1 oc because unique tracers were not measured. pmf resolved “shipping and other heavy fuel oil combustion” and sea spray sources based on inorganic tracers v and br. the pmf factor rich in sb very likely comes from brake wear associated with on-road vehicles and railway operations. the undefined sn factor may be indicative of local industrial sources and traffic emission, but further research will be required to confirm this hypothesis. the pm0.1 source apportionment results contained in the current study further characterize the seasonal and spatial patterns of ufp concentrations in california. © 2020 elsevier b.v. california; factor

matter (pm) is associated with increased risk of dementia and accelerated cognitive loss. vascular contributions to cognitive impairment are well recognized. chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (cch) promotes neuroinflammation and blood– brain barrier weakening, which may augment neurotoxic effects of pm. objectives: this study examined interactions of nanoscale particulate matter (npm; fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤200 nm) and cch secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (bcas) in a murine model to produce white matter injury. based on other air pollution interac-tions, we predicted synergies of npm with bcas. methods: npm was collected using a particle sampler near a los angeles, california, freeway. mice were exposed to 10 wk of reaerosolized npm or filtered air (fa) for 150 h. cch was induced by bcas surgery. mice (c57bl/6j males) were randomized to four exposure paradigms: a) fa, b) npm, c) fa + bcas, and d) npm + bcas. behavioral outcomes, white matter injury, glial cell activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed. results: the joint npm + bcas group exhibited synergistic effects on white matter injury (2.3× the additive npm and fa + bcas scores) with greater loss of corpus callosum volume on t2 magnetic resonance imaging (mri) (30% smaller than fa group). histochemical analyses suggested potential microglial-specific inflammatory responses with synergistic effects on corpus callosum c5 immunofluorescent density and whole brain ni-trate concentrations (2.1× and 3.9× the additive npm and fa + bcas effects, respectively) in the joint exposure group. transcriptomic responses (rna-seq) showed greater impact of npm + bcas than individual additive effects, consistent with changes in proinflammatory pathways. although npm exposure alone did not alter working memory, the npm + bcas cohort demonstrated impaired working memory when compared to the fa + bcas group. discussion: our data suggest that npm and cch contribute to white matter injury in a synergistic manner in a mouse model. adverse neurological effects may be aggravated in a susceptible population exposed to air pollution. © 2021, public health services, us dept of health and human services. all rights reserved.  air pollution; animals; cerebrovascular circulation; disease models, animal; male; mice; mice,

concentrations and sources of redox-active metals and trace elements in central los angeles over the period of 2005–2018. mass concentrations of pm2.5-bound metals and crustal elements were obtained from the chemical speciation network (csn) database provided by the us environmental protection agency (us epa). the recorded metal concentrations showed considerable variations throughout the study period, but they generally followed a descending trend from 2005 to 2018. the decline in annual average concentration of metals was more pronounced for v and ni. in order to further investigate and interpret the observed decreasing trends, this dataset of 2005–2018 was employed in the positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to determine the contribution of different sources to the total metals’ concentrations and their trends over time. four major sources were identified by the pmf model, including mineral dust, re-suspended road dust, combustion, and tire wear. mineral dust (50 ± 8%) and re-suspended road dust (38 ± 13%) were the dominant contributors to total metal concentrations, followed by combustion emissions (9 ± 8%) and tire wear (2 ± 1%). while the pmf results showed generally consistent contributions of mineral dust to total metals concentration throughout the investigation period, the contribution of re-suspended road dust to total metals increased from 2013 to 2018 probably due to the increased road traffic (expressed in the form of vehicle miles traveled, vmt) as well as the growing use of electric vehicles (evs) (which increases resuspension of road dust particles due to their heavy weight) in the area during the same period. in contrast, the contribution of combustion emissions decreased by almost 88% from 2005 to 2018. using the pmf-resolved factor profiles, we investigated the contribution of the four identified sources to selected individual metals (i.e., ba, br, fe, ni, pb, ti, v, and zn). the observed decrease in the mass concentration of v and ni over time was attributed to the reduction in combustion sources and particularly industrial emissions, further corroborating the effectiveness of aftertreatment and air quality policies in reducing the levels of redox-active metals across los angeles. © 2021 elsevier ltd metals; non-tailpipe emissions; pmf; road dust; source apportionment; trace elements california; los angeles

chemical characteristics of standardized diesel exhaust particles (dep) and compared them to those of read-world particulate matter (pm) collected in different urban settings to evaluate the extent to which standardized deps can represent ambient particles for use in toxicological studies. standard reference material srm-2975 was obtained from the national institute of standards and technology (nist) and was chemically analyzed for the content of elemental carbon (ec), organic carbon (oc), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), inorganic ions, and several metals and trace elements. the analysis on the filter-collected dep sample revealed very high levels of ec (i.e., ~397 ng/μg pm) which were comparable to the oc content (~405 ng/μg pm). this is in contrast with the carbonaceous content in the emitted particles from typical filter-equipped diesel-powered vehicles, in which low levels of ec emissions were observed. furthermore, the ec mass fraction of the dep sample did not match the observed levels in the ambient pm of multiple us urban areas, including los angeles (8%), houston (~14%), pittsburgh (~12%), and new york (~17%). our results illustrated the lack of several high molecular weight carcinogenic pahs in the dep samples, unlike our measurements in major freeways of los angeles. negligible levels of inorganic ions were observed in the sample and the dep did not contain toxic secondary organic aerosols (soas) formed through synchronized reactions in the atmosphere. lastly, the analysis of redox-active metals and trace elements demonstrated that the levels of many species including vehicle emission tracers (e.g., ba, ti, mn, fe) on los angeles roadways were almost 20 times greater than those in the dep sample. based on the abovementioned inconsistencies between the chemical composition of the dep sample and those of real-world pm measured and recorded in different conditions, we conclude that the standardized deps are not suitable representatives of traffic emissions nor typical ambient pm to be used in toxicological studies. © 2021 elsevier b.v. diesel exhaust particles (deps); health impacts; particulate matter; standard material; toxicological

angeles basin in this study, the emission factors of pm10and its chemical constituents from various contributing sources including nontailpipe and tailpipe emissions were estimated on two interstate freeways in the los angeles basin. pm10samples were collected on the i-110 and i-710 freeways as well as at the university of southern california (usc) campus as the urban background site, while freeway and urban background co2levels were measured simultaneously. pm10samples were analyzed for their content of chemical species which were used to estimate the emission factors of pm10and its constituents on both i-110 and i-710 freeways. the estimated values were employed to determine the emission factors for light (ldv) and heavy-duty vehicles (hdv). the quantified species were also processed by the positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to produce pm10freeway source profiles and their contribution to pm10mass concentrations. using the pmf factor profiles and emission factors on the two freeways, we characterized the emission factors for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles by each nontailpipe source. our findings indicated higher nontailpipe emission factors of pm10and metal elements on the i-710 freeway compared to the i-110 freeway, due to the higher fraction of heavy-duty vehicles (hdvs) on that freeway. furthermore, the generation of nontailpipe pm10from resuspension of road dust was twice of tire and brake wear. the results of this study provide significant insights into pm10freeway emissions and particularly the overall contribution of nontailpipe and tailpipe sources in los angeles, which can be helpful to modelers and air quality officials in assessing the importance of individual traffic-related emissions on the overall population exposure.

matter (pm) in different regions around the world and its relation to air pollution sources in this study, we investigated the impact of urban emission sources on the chemical composition of ambient particulate matter (pm) as well as the associated oxidative potential. we collected six sets of pm samples in five urban location sites around the world over long time periods varying from weeks to months, intentionally selected for their pm to be dominated by unique emission sources: (1) pm2.5 produced mainly by traffic emissions in central los angeles, united states (us); (2) pm2.5 dominated by biomass burning in milan, italy; (3) pm2.5 formed by secondary photochemical reactions thus dominated by secondary aerosols in athens, greece; (4) pm10 emitted by refinery and dust resuspension in riyadh, saudi arabia (sa); (5) pm10 generated by dust storms in riyadh, sa, and (6) pm2.5 produced mainly by industrial and traffic emissions in beirut, lebanon. the pm samples were chemically analyzed and their oxidative potential were quantified by employing the dithiothreitol (dtt) assay. our results revealed that the milan samples were rich in water soluble organic carbon (wsoc) and pahs, even exceeding the levels measured on los angeles (la) freeways. the pm in athens was characterized by high concentrations of inorganic ions, specifically sulfate which was the highest of all pm samples. the ambient pm in la was impacted by the traffic-emitted primary organic and elemental carbon. furthermore, the contribution of metals and elements per mass of pm in riyadh and beirut samples were more pronounced relative to other sampling areas. the highest intrinsic pm redox activity was observed for pm with the highest wsoc fraction, including milan (biomass burning) and athens (secondary organic aerosols, soa). pm in areas characterized by high metal emissions including dust events, refinery and industry, such as riyadh and beirut, had the lowest oxidative potential as assessed by the dtt assay. the results of this study illustrate the impact of major emission sources in urban areas on the redox activity and oxidative potential of ambient pm, providing useful information for developing efficient air pollution control and mitigation policies in polluted areas around the globe. © 2022 rsc.  ;los angeles basin's air quality transformation: a long-term investigation on the impacts of pm regulations on the trends of ultrafine particles and co-pollutants this study investigates the long-term trends of ambient ultrafine particles (ufps) and associated airborne pollutants in the los angeles basin from 2007 to 2022, focusing on the indirect effects of regulations on ufp levels. the particle number concentration (pnc) of ufps was compiled from previous studies in the area, and associated co-pollutant data, including nitrogen oxides (nox), carbon monoxide (co), elemental carbon (ec), organic carbon (oc), and ozone (o3), were obtained from the chemical speciation network (csn) database. over the study period, a general decrease was noted in the pnc of ufps, nox, ec, and oc, except for co, the concentration trends of which did not exhibit a consistent pattern. ufps, nox, ec, and oc were positively correlated, while o3 had a negative correlation, especially with nox. our analysis discerned two distinct sub-periods in pollutant trends: 2007–2015 and 2016–2022. for example, there was an overall decrease in the pnc of ufps at an annual rate of −850.09 particles/cm3/year. this rate was more pronounced during the first sub-period (2007–2015) at −1814.9 particles/cm3/year and then slowed to −227.21 particles/cm3/year in the second sub-period (2016–2023). the first sub-period (2007–2015) significantly influenced pollutant level changes, exhibiting more pronounced and statistically significant changes than the second sub-period (2016–2022). since 2016, almost all primary pollutants have stabilized, indicating a reduced impact of current regulations, and emphasizing the need for stricter standards. in addition, the study included an analysis of vehicle miles traveled (vmt) trends from 2007 to 2022 within the los angeles basin. despite the general increase in vmt, current regulations and cleaner technologies seem to have successfully mitigated the potential increase in increase in pnc. overall, while a decline in ufps and co-pollutant levels was observed, the apparent stabilization of these levels underscores the need for more stringent regulatory measures and advanced emission standards. © 2023

central los angeles in this study, we investigated aerosol chemical composition, spectral properties of aerosol extracts, and source contributions to the aerosol light-absorbing brown carbon (brc) in central los angeles from july 2018 to march 2019, during warm and cold seasons. spectrophotometric measurements (water and methanol extracts; 200 < λ < 1100) and chemical analyses were performed on collected particulate matter (pm), and relationships of brc light absorption (abs365) to source tracer chemical species were evaluated. mass absorption efficiency (mae) of both water and methanol extracted solutions exhibited an increasing trend from warm period to cold season, with an annual average value of 0.61 ± 0.22 m2.g− 1 and 1.38 ± 0.89 m2.g− 1, respectively. principal component analysis (pca) were coupled with multiple linear regression (mlr) to identify and quantify sources of brc light absorption in each of the seasons. our finding documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant source of brc light absorption during warm season, with relative contribution of 38% to total brc light absorption, followed by (secondary organic aerosol) soa (30%) and biomass burning (12%). in contrast, biomass burning was the major source of brc during the cold season (53%), while fossil fuel combustion and soa contributed to 18% and 12% of brc, respectively. significantly higher contribution of biomass burning to brc during the cold season suggested that residential heating activities (wood burning) play a major role in increased brc concentrations. previously collected aethalometer model data documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant contributing source to >90% of bc throughout the year. finally, the solar radiation absorption ratio of brc to elemental carbon (ec) in the ultraviolet range (300–400 nm) was maximum during the cold season with the annual corresponding values of 13–25% and 17–29% for water- and methanol-soluble brc, respectively; which provides further evidence of the important effect of brc light absorption on atmospheric radiative balance. © 2019 elsevier b.v. brc light absorption; pca-mlr; source apportionment; spectrophotometric

sources of ambient coarse particles (2.5 <dp < 10 μm) and to disentangle their association and contribution from other pollutants, particularly pm2.5 (<2.5 μm). a semi-continuous sampling campaign was conducted using two virtual impactors/concentrators to enhance coarse particulate matter concentrations coupled with an online thermal-optical ec/oc monitor to quantify coarse pm–bound organic carbon volatility fractions (oc1-oc4) in central los angeles during the winter, spring, and summer of 2021. the total oc and its volatility fraction concentrations, meteorological parameters (i.e., wind speeds and relative humidity), vehicle miles traveled (vmt), and gaseous source tracers (i.e., o3 and no2) were used as inputs to positive matrix factorization (pmf) model. a 3-factor solution identified vehicular emissions (accounting for 46% in the cold phase and 26% in the warm phase of total coarse oc concentrations), secondary organic carbon (27% and 37%), and re-suspended dust (27% and 37%) as the primary organic carbon sources of coarse pm. the re-suspended dust factor showed a higher contribution of more volatile organic carbons (i.e., oc1 up to 77%) due to their re-distribution on dust particles, whereas the soa factor was the dominant contributor to less volatile organic aerosols (i.e., oc4 up to 54%), which are the product of reactions at high relative humidity (rh). our findings revealed that the total oc concentrations in the coarse size range were comparable with those of previous studies in the area, underscoring the challenges in curtailing coarse pm-bound oc sources and the necessity of developing effective emission control regulations on coarse pm. the results from the current study provide insights into the seasonal and temporal variation of total oc and its volatility fractions in los angeles. © 2022 elsevier ltd aqueous phase reactions; coarse particulate matter; los angeles; oc volatility fractions; soa aerosols; air

however, the mechanisms of this injury are not well understood and remain largely uncharacterized in experimental models. prior studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter (pm), a sub-fraction of air pollution, results in neuroinflammation, specifically the upregulation of inflammatory microglia. this study examines white matter and axonal injury, and characterizes microglial reactivity in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to 10 weeks (150 hours) of pm. nanoscale particulate matter (npm, aerodynamic diameter ≤200 nm) consisting primarily of traffic-related emissions was collected from an urban area in los angeles. male c57bl/6j mice were exposed to either re-aerosolized npm or filtered air for 5 hours/day, 3 days/week, for 10 weeks (150 hours; n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license,

ambient concentrations of primary and secondary organic aerosol in central los angeles using an integrated approach coupling source apportionment with regression analysis the main objective of this study was to explore the correlations between carbonaceous pm2.5 species (i.e., primary and secondary organic aerosols (poas and soas) and elemental carbon (ec)) with various criteria gaseous pollutants over the 2015–2019 period in order to devise a simple way of estimating the 24-hr concentration of these pm species in central los angeles. the positive matrix factorization (pmf) model was used to determine the contribution of various sources to organic carbon (oc) and its volatility fractions (oc1-oc3) in the atmosphere in years of 2015, 2017, and 2019. a 5-factor solution that includes vehicular exhaust emissions (traced by ec and oc1), non-tailpipe emissions (characterized by ti, cu, and zn), soas (identified by sulfate and ozone), biomass burning (associated with high loadings of k+/k), and local industrial activities (traced by cr) was identified as the most physically interpretable solution for each of the investigated years. the soa concentrations determined using the pmf model output and the poa concentrations, calculated by subtracting the soa concentrations from the total oc mass, were employed in our regression analysis with criteria gaseous pollutants, the concentrations of which are routinely reported by the air quality agencies. the result of the regression analysis revealed high correlation between the concentrations of soa and ozone (r2 > 0.74) in different years, probably because they are originated from synchronized photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. the soa/o3 ratios were between ∼47-56 μg/m3/ppm in the time period of 2015–2019. a strong correlation between poa and co was also observed (r2 > 0.70); the poa/co ratios decreased from about 6.5 to 5 μg/m3/ppm from 2015 to 2019, which is consistent with the trend of tailpipe emission contributions to total oc concentrations in our monitoring site. ec was also strongly correlated with no2 (r2 > 0.73) and co (r2 > 0.70) because they are emitted from the same combustion sources (e.g., vehicular emissions in central los angeles). our results show persistent and significant correlations between the concentrations of criteria gaseous pollutants and carbonaceous pm2.5 species (i.e., poa, soa, and ec) in different years, offering a straightforward approach to estimate the 24-h average concentration of these pm species in central los angeles. ©

three mid-latitude metropolitan cities lifetime cancer risk characterization of ambient pm-bound carcinogenic metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) were examined in the cities of los angeles (usa), thessaloniki (greece) and milan (italy), which share similar mediterranean climates but are different in their urban emission sources and governing air quality regulations. the samples in milan and thessaloniki were mostly dominated by biomass burning activities whereas the particles collected in los angeles were primary impacted by traffic emissions. we analyzed the ambient pm2.5 mass concentration of cadmium (cd), hexavalent chromium (cr(vi)), nickel (ni), lead (pb), as well as 13 pah compounds in the pm samples, collected during both cold and warm periods at each location. pb exhibited the highest annual average concentration in all three cities, followed by ni, as, cr(vi), cd and pahs, respectively. the cancer risk assessment based on outdoor pollutants was performed based on three different scenarios, with each scenario corresponding to a different level of infiltration of outdoor pollutants into the indoor environment. thessaloniki exhibited a high risk associated with lifetime inhalation of as, cr(vi), and pahs, with values in the range of (0.97–1.57) × 10−6, (1.80–2.91) × 10−6, and (0.77–1.25) × 10−6, respectively. the highest cancer risk values were calculated in milan, exceeding the us epa standard by a considerable margin, where the lifetime risk values of exposure to as, cr(vi), and pahs were in the range of (1.29–2.08) × 10−6, (6.08–9.82) × 10−6, and (1.10–1.77) × 10−6, respectively. in contrast, the estimated risks associated with pahs and metals, except cr(vi), in los angeles were extremely lower than the guideline value, even when the infiltration factor was assumed to be at peak. the lifetime cancer risk values associated with as, cd, ni, pb, and pahs in los angeles were in the range of (0.04–0.33) × 10−6. this observation highlights the impact of local air quality measures in improving the air quality and lowering the cancer risks in los angeles compared to the other two cities. © 2023 by the authors.

and oxidative potential of aqueous pm2.5 suspensions collected via an aerosol-into-liquid collector for use in toxicology studies in this study, we investigated the organic constituents and toxicological characteristics of pm2.5 liquid suspensions collected by the means of a modified versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (vaces)/aerosol-into-liquid collector tandem technology. filter and slurry pm2.5 samples were collected during warm (spanning from mid-august 2019 to early-september 2019) and cold (from mid-december 2019 to early-january 2020) seasons at an urban site in central los angeles. the collected samples were chemically analyzed for their total organic carbon (toc) as well as individual organic species, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), hopanes and steranes, n-alkanes, and organic acids. in addition, the oxidative potential of pm2.5 samples was quantified by means of the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (dcfh) in vitro assay. overall, our findings revealed a very good agreement between the mass fractions of organic compounds in the collected pm2.5 slurries and filters, judging by the average slurry-to -filter ratios of 1.17 ± 0.15, 1.13 ± 0.14, 1.13 ± 0.15, and 1.16 ± 0.22 for pahs, hopanes and steranes, n-alkanes, and organic acids, respectively. moreover, comparable (pvalue = 0.2) oxidative potential levels were observed between the collected filters and pm2.5 liquid suspensions. the aqueous pm suspensions collected by the vaces/aerosol-into-liquid collector exhibited slightly higher (although not statistically significant) capture of some semi-volatile organic compounds (svocs), probably due to less sampling artifacts and better preservation of these svocs collected directly into aqueous suspensions compared to the filter samplers. the outcomes of this study confirm the efficient collection of pm-bound organic species in aqueous slurries by the aerosol-into-liquid collector, further corroborating the ability of this sampler to be used as an attractive alternative to filter samplers for collection of pm2.5 for toxicological studies. © 2020 elsevier ltd aerosol-into-liquid

compounds and relationships to the oxidative potential of urban airborne particles were investigated in central los angeles, ca. ambient and thermodenuded fine (pm2.5) particles were collected during both warm and cold seasons by employing the versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (vaces) combined with a thermodenuder. when operated at 50 °c and 100 °c, the vaces/thermodenuder system removed about 50% and 75% of the pm2.5 vol concentration, respectively. most of the quantified pm2.5 semi-volatile species including organic carbon (oc), water soluble organic carbon (wsoc), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), organic acids, n-alkanes, and levoglucosan, as well as inorganic ions (i.e., nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) exhibited concentration losses in the ranges of 40–66% and 67–92%, respectively, as the thermodenuder temperature increased to 50 °c and 100 °c. species in the pm2.5 such as elemental carbon (ec) and inorganic elements (including trace metals) were minimally impacted by the heating process – thus can be considered refractory. on average, nearly half of the pm2.5 oxidative potential (as measured by the dichlorodihydrofluorescein (dcfh) alveolar macrophage in vitro assay) was associated with the semi-volatile species removed by heating the aerosols to only 50 °c, highlighting the importance of this quite volatile compartment to the ambient pm2.5 toxicity. the fraction of pm2.5 oxidative potential lost upon heating the aerosols to 100 °c further increased to around 75–85%. furthermore, we document statistically significant correlations between the pm2.5 oxidative potential and different semi-volatile organic compounds originating from primary and secondary sources, including oc (rwarm, and rcold) (0.86, and 0.74), wsoc (0.60, and 0.98), pahs (0.88, and 0.76), organic acids (0.76, and 0.88), and n-alkanes (0.67, and 0.83) in warm and cold seasons, respectively, while a strong correlation between oxidative potential and levoglucosan, a tracer of biomass burning, was observed only during the cold season (rcold = 0.81). © 2019 elsevier ltd dcfh assay; gas-particle partitioning; pm<sub>2.5</sub> oxidative potential;

(2) pm2.5 dominated by biomass burning in milan, italy; (3) pm2.5 formed by secondary photochemical reactions thus dominated by secondary aerosols in athens, greece; (4) pm10 emitted by refinery and dust resuspension in riyadh, saudi arabia (sa); (5) pm10 generated by dust storms in riyadh, sa, and (6) pm2.5 produced mainly by industrial and traffic emissions in beirut, lebanon. the pm samples were chemically analyzed and their oxidative potential were quantified by employing the dithiothreitol (dtt) assay. our results revealed that the milan samples were rich in water soluble organic carbon (wsoc) and pahs, even exceeding the levels measured on los angeles (la) freeways. the pm in athens was characterized by high concentrations of inorganic ions, specifically sulfate which was the highest of all pm samples. the ambient pm in la was impacted by the traffic-emitted primary organic and elemental carbon. furthermore, the contribution of metals and elements per mass of pm in riyadh and beirut samples were more pronounced relative to other sampling areas. the highest intrinsic pm redox activity was observed for pm with the highest wsoc fraction, including milan (biomass burning) and athens (secondary organic aerosols, soa). pm in areas characterized by high metal emissions including dust events, refinery and industry, such as riyadh and beirut, had the lowest oxidative potential as assessed by the dtt assay. the results of this study illustrate the impact of major emission sources in urban areas on the redox activity and oxidative potential of ambient pm, providing useful information for developing efficient air pollution control and mitigation policies in polluted areas around the globe. © 2022 rsc.  ;long-term trends in concentrations and sources of pm2.5–bound metals and elements in central los angeles in this study, we investigated long-term trends in the ambient concentrations and sources of redox-active metals and trace elements in central los angeles over the period of 2005–2018. mass concentrations of pm2.5-bound metals and crustal elements were obtained from the chemical speciation network (csn) database provided by the us environmental protection agency (us epa). the recorded metal concentrations showed considerable variations throughout the study period, but they generally followed a descending trend from 2005 to 2018. the decline in annual average concentration of metals was more pronounced for v and ni. in order to further investigate and interpret the observed decreasing trends, this dataset of 2005–2018 was employed in the positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to determine the contribution of different sources to the total metals’ concentrations and their trends over time. four major sources were identified by the pmf model, including mineral dust, re-suspended road dust, combustion, and tire wear. mineral dust (50 ± 8%) and re-suspended road dust (38 ± 13%) were the dominant contributors to total metal concentrations, followed by combustion emissions (9 ± 8%) and tire wear (2 ± 1%). while the pmf results showed generally consistent contributions of mineral dust to total metals concentration throughout the investigation period, the contribution of re-suspended road dust to total metals increased from 2013 to 2018 probably due to the increased road traffic (expressed in the form of vehicle miles traveled, vmt) as well as the growing use of electric vehicles (evs) (which increases resuspension of road dust particles due to their heavy weight) in the area during the same period. in contrast, the contribution of combustion emissions decreased by almost 88% from 2005 to 2018. using the pmf-resolved factor profiles, we investigated the contribution of the four identified sources to selected individual metals (i.e., ba, br, fe, ni, pb, ti, v, and zn). the observed decrease in the mass concentration of v and ni over time was attributed to the reduction in combustion sources and particularly industrial emissions, further corroborating the effectiveness of aftertreatment and air quality policies in reducing the levels of redox-active metals across los angeles. © 2021 elsevier ltd metals;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

however, the impacts of these operations on neighborhood air quality are not well characterized. in this research, we leveraged ambient air monitoring adjacent to an oil and gas production site in los angeles, california during active and idle periods. this study analyzed continuous methane (ch4) and non-methane hydrocarbon (nmhc) measurements, together with triggered grab samples and 24 hour integrated canister samples collected by the south coast air quality management district. ambient air pollutant levels and trends were evaluated during active and idle well operations to assess changes in neighborhood air quality after the suspension of oil and gas production. we find that mean concentrations of methane, nmhc, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene, n-hexane, n-pentane, ethane, and propane decreased following the stop in production activities. using a source apportionment approach, we observed that the ""natural gas""drilling source contributed 23.7% to the total vocs measured during the active phase, and only 0.6% to the total measured vocs in the idle phase. near urban oil and gas production sites, residents may face poorer air quality due to the oil and gas activities which may pose adverse health and environmental risks among proximate communities.  © the royal society of chemistry.  air pollutants;

communities of color are disproportionately burdened by poor air quality and more likely to live near industrial facilities and freeways. government regulatory monitors do not have the spatial resolution to provide air quality information at the neighborhood or personal scale. we describe the a day in the life program, an approach to participatory air monitoring that engages youth in collecting data that they can then analyze and use to take action. academics partnered with los angeles-based youth environmental justice organizations to combine personal air monitoring, participatory science, and digital storytelling to build capacity to address local air quality issues. eighteen youth participants from four different neighborhoods wore portable personal pm2.5 (fine particles <2.5 µm in diameter) monitors for a day in each of their respective communities, documenting and mapping their exposure to pm2.5 during their daily routine. air monitoring was coupled with photography and videos to document what they experienced over the course of their day. the pm2.5 exposure during the day for participants averaged 10.7 µg/m3, although the range stretched from <1 to 180 µg/m3. one-third of all measurements were taken <300 m from a freeway. overall, we demonstrate a method to increase local youth-centered understanding of personal exposures, pollution sources, and vulnerability to air quality. © 2019 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. air pollution;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

however, most studies are limited in investigating longitudinal changes in these acute effects. this study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. methods: we conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8–16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. we deployed the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit developed in the los angeles prisms center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (gps), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. hourly ambient (pm2.5, nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (nox) and pm2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. we used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (pef), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. results: participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4–16.8) with mean (sd) morning %predicted fev1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and pef of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use. participants reported chest tightness, wheeze, trouble breathing, and cough symptoms on 36.4%, 17.5%, 32.3%, and 42.9%, respectively (n = 217 person-days). one sd increase in previous day o3 exposure was associated with reduced morning (beta [95% ci]: −4.11 [−6.86, −1.36]), evening (−2.65 [−5.19, −0.10]) and daily average %predicted fev1 (−3.45 [−6.42, −0.47]). daily (lag 0) exposure to traffic-related pm2.5 exposure was associated with reduced morning %predicted pef (−3.97 [−7.69, −0.26]) and greater odds of “feeling scared of trouble breathing” symptom (odds ratio [95% ci]: 1.83 [1.03, 3.24]). exposure to ambient o3, nox, and no was significantly associated with increased rescue inhaler use (rate ratio [95% ci]: o3 1.52 [1.02, 2.27], nox 1.61 [1.23, 2.11], no 1.80 [1.37, 2.35]). conclusions: we found significant associations of air pollution exposure with lung function, rescue inhaler use, and “feeling scared of trouble breathing.” our study demonstrates the potential of informatics and wearable sensor technologies at collecting highly resolved, contextual, and personal exposure data for understanding acute pediatric asthma triggers. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. gps;

health","ev-mirna associated with environmental air pollution exposures in the madres cohort air pollution is a hazardous contaminant, exposure to which has substantial consequences for health during critical periods, such as pregnancy. microrna (mirna) is an epigenetic mechanism that modulates transcriptome responses to the environment and has been found to change in reaction to air pollution exposure. the data are limited regarding extracellular-vesicle (ev) mirna variation associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy and in susceptible populations who may be disproportionately exposed. this study aimed to identify ev-mirna expression associated with ambient, residential exposure to pm2.5, pm10, no2, o3 and with traffic-related nox in 461 participants of the madres cohort, a low income, predominantly hispanic pregnancy cohort based in los angeles, ca. this study used residence-based modeled air pollution data as well as nanostring panels for evmirna extracted with qiagen exorneasy kits to evaluate 483 mirna in plasma in early and late pregnancy. average air pollution exposures were considered separately for 1-day, 1-week, and 8-week windows before blood collection in both early and late pregnancy. this study identified 63 and 66 evmirna significantly associated with pm2.5 and pm10, respectively, and 2 mirna associated with traffic-related nox (false discovery rate-adjusted p-value < .05). of 103 unique ev-mirna associated with pm, 92% were associated with lung conditions according to hmdd (human mirna disease database) evidence. in particular, ev-mirna previously identified with air pollution exposure also associated with pm2.5 and pm10 in this study were: mir-126, mir-16-5p, mir-187-3p, mir200b-3p, mir486-3p, and mir-582-3p. there were no significant differences in average exposures in early vs late pregnancy. significant ev-mirnas were only identified in late pregnancy with an 8-week exposure window, suggesting a vulnerable timeframe of exposure, rather than an acute response. these results describe a wide array of ev-mirna for which expression is affected by pm exposure and may be in part mediating the biological response to ambient air pollution, with potential for health implications in pregnant women and their children. © the author(s) 2024. published by oxford university press. air pollution; microrna; particulate

exposures during pregnancy and early postpartum background: fine particulate matter (pm2.5) exposure is an important environmental risk for maternal and children's health, with peak exposures especially those derived from primary combustion hypothesized to pose greater risk. identifying pm2.5 peaks and their contributions to personal exposure remains challenging. this study measured personal pm2.5 exposure, characterized primary combustion peaks, and investigated their determinants during and after pregnancy and among hispanic women in los angeles, ca. methods: continuous personal pm2.5 exposure, global positioning system geolocation, and ecological momentary assessment surveys were collected from 63 women for 4 consecutive days in their 1st trimester, 3rd trimester and 4–6 months postpartum. based on the shape of pm2.5 time-series, primary combustion peaks were identified, characterized (number, duration, area under the curve [auc]), and linked with locations they occurred in. zero-inflated generalized mixed-effect models were used to examine the spatial and temporal determinants of pm2.5 peak exposures. results: a total of 490 pm2.5 peaks were identified from 618 person-days of monitoring. spending an additional minute at parks and open spaces was related to smaller (auc decreased 3.1 %, 95 % ci: 1.5 %–4.6 %) and shorter (duration decreased 1.7 %, 0.5 %–2.9 %) pm2.5 peak exposure. an additional minute in vehicular trips also related to smaller and shorter peak exposure (auc and duration decreased 2.5 %, 1.2 %–3.7 % and 1.8 %, 1.0 %–2.6 %, respectively). however, an additional minute at industrial locations was associated with greater number (3.6 %, 2.0 %–5.2 %), auc (1.6 %, 0.1 %–3.2 %) and duration (1.0 %, 0.0 %–2.1 %) of personal pm2.5 peak exposure. conclusions: this study demonstrates the potential to statistically identify exposure to primary combustion pm2.5 peaks and understand their determinants from personal monitoring data. results suggest that visits to parks and open spaces may minimize pm2.5 peak exposures, while visiting industrial locations may increase them in and around pregnancy. © 2024 fine particulate matter; microenvironment; peak exposures; personal exposure; primary combustion; time-activity ;sources of personal pm2.5 exposure during pregnancy in the madres cohort background: personal exposure to fine particulate matter (pm2.5) is impacted by different sources each with different chemical composition. determining these sources is important for reducing personal exposure and its health risks especially during pregnancy. objective: identify main sources and their contributions to the personal pm2.5 exposure in 213 women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in los angeles, ca. methods: we measured 48-hr integrated personal pm2.5 exposure and analyzed filters for pm2.5 mass, elemental composition, and optical carbon fractions. we used the epa positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to resolve and quantify the major sources of personal pm2.5 exposure. we then investigated bivariate relationships between sources, time-activity patterns, and environmental exposures in activity spaces and residential neighborhoods to further understand sources. results: mean personal pm2.5 mass concentration was 22.3 (sd = 16.6) μg/m3. twenty-five species and pm2.5 mass were used in pmf with a final r2 of 0.48. we identified six sources (with major species in profiles and % contribution to pm2.5 mass) as follows: secondhand smoking (shs) (brown carbon, environmental tobacco smoke; 65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure; pm<sub>2.5</sub>; pregnancy; secondhand smoking source; source

is a contaminant of top public health concern, due to its range of detrimental health effects. arsenic exposure has not been well-characterized among the us hispanic populations and has been particularly understudied in this population during pregnancy. methods: as part of the madres ongoing pregnancy cohort of predominantly lower-income, hispanic women in los angeles, ca, we examined levels of maternal first trimester urinary as, including total as and as metabolites (inorganic (ias), monomethylated (mma) and dimethylated as (dma)), in relation to participant demographics, lifestyle characteristics, and rice/seafood consumption, to identify factors that may influence as exposure and its metabolites during pregnancy (n = 241). results: total as concentrations ranged from low to high (0.8–506.2 μg/l, mean: 9.0 μg/l, sd: 32.9) in our study population. foreign-born hispanic women had 8.6% higher %dma (95% ci: 3.3%, 13.9%) and −7.7% lower %ias (95% ci: −12.6%, −2.9%) than non-hispanic women. a similar trend was observed for us-born hispanic women. in addition, maternal age was associated with 0.4% higher %ias (95% ci: 0.1%, 0.6%) and 0.4% lower %dma (95% ci: −0.7%, −0.1%) per year, which may indicate poor as methylation capacity. conclusion: individual factors may predict as exposure and metabolism in pregnancy, and in turn, greater risk of adverse health effects. © 2020, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature america, inc. arsenic; cohort; environment; health disparities; hispanic; pregnancy arsenic; arsenicals; cohort studies;

pollution and pediatric asthma risk using the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit background: exposure to air pollution is associated with acute pediatric asthma exacerba-tions, including reduced lung function, rescue medication usage, and increased symptoms; however, most studies are limited in investigating longitudinal changes in these acute effects. this study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. methods: we conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8–16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. we deployed the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit developed in the los angeles prisms center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (gps), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. hourly ambient (pm2.5, nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (nox) and pm2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. we used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (pef), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. results: participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4–16.8) with mean (sd) morning %predicted fev1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and pef of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use. participants reported chest tightness, wheeze, trouble breathing, and cough symptoms on 36.4%, 17.5%, 32.3%, and 42.9%, respectively (n = 217 person-days). one sd increase in previous day o3 exposure was associated with reduced morning (beta [95% ci]: −4.11 [−6.86, −1.36]), evening (−2.65 [−5.19, −0.10]) and daily average %predicted fev1 (−3.45 [−6.42, −0.47]). daily (lag 0) exposure to traffic-related pm2.5 exposure was associated with reduced morning %predicted pef (−3.97 [−7.69, −0.26]) and greater odds of “feeling scared of trouble breathing” symptom (odds ratio [95% ci]: 1.83 [1.03, 3.24]). exposure to ambient o3, nox, and no was significantly associated with increased rescue inhaler use (rate ratio [95% ci]: o3 1.52 [1.02, 2.27], nox 1.61 [1.23, 2.11], no 1.80 [1.37, 2.35]). conclusions: we found significant associations of air pollution exposure with lung function, rescue inhaler use, and “feeling scared of trouble breathing.” our study demonstrates the potential of informatics and wearable sensor technologies at collecting highly resolved, contextual, and personal exposure data for understanding acute pediatric asthma triggers. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. gps; mobile health; pediatric asthma; personal air pollution; prisms; sensors air pollutants; air pollution; asthma; child;

spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., neighborhood, hourly) is challenging. recent growth in low cost sensor networks is providing increased spatial coverage of air quality data that can be used to supplement data provided by monitors of regulatory agencies. we developed an hourly, 500 × 500 m gridded pm2.5 model that integrates purpleair low-cost air sensor network data for los angeles county. we developed a quality control scheme for purpleair data. we included spatially and temporally varying predictors in a random forest model with random oversampling of high concentrations to predict pm2.5. the model achieved high prediction accuracy (10-fold cross-validation (cv) r2 = 0.93, root mean squared error (rmse) = 3.23 μg/m3; spatial cv r2 = 0.88, spatial rmse = 4.33 μg/m3; temporal cv r2 = 0.90, temporal rmse = 3.85 μg/m3). our model was able to predict spatial and diurnal patterns in pm2.5 on typical weekdays and weekends, as well as non-typical days, such as holidays and wildfire days. the model allows for far more precise estimates of pm2.5 than existing methods based on few sensors. taking advantage of low-cost pm2.5 sensors, our hourly random forest model predictions can be combined with time-activity diaries in future studies, enabling geographically and temporally fine exposure estimation for specific population groups in studies of acute air pollution health effects and studies of environmental justice issues. © 2020 air pollution; fine particulate matter; purpleair sensors; random forest model air pollutants; air pollution; environmental monitoring; humans; los

modification by prenatal depression background: air pollution has been associated with gestational hypertension (gh) and preeclampsia, but susceptible windows of exposure and potential vulnerability by comorbidities, such as prenatal depression, remain unclear. methods: we ascertained gh and preeclampsia cases in a prospective pregnancy cohort in los angeles, ca daily levels of ambient particulate matters (with a diameter of ≤10 μm [pm10] or ≤2.5 μm [pm2.5]), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone were averaged for each week from 12 weeks preconception to 20 gestational weeks. we used distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows, adjusting for potential confounders. analyses were additionally stratified by probable prenatal depression to explore population vulnerability. results: among 619 participants, 60 developed preeclampsia and 42 developed gh. we identified a susceptible window for exposure to pm2.5from 1 week preconception to 11 weeks postconception: higher exposure (5 μg/m3) within this window was associated with an average of 8% (95% ci, 1%-15%) higher risk of gh. among participants with probable prenatal depression (n=179; 32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution; depression; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; preeclampsia; pregnancy

madres cohort background: in-utero exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (pm2.5) is associated with low birth weight and health risks later in life. pregnant women are mobile and locations they spend time in contribute to their personal pm2.5 exposures. therefore, it is important to understand how mobility and exposures encountered within activity spaces contribute to personal pm2.5 exposures during pregnancy. methods: we collected 48-h integrated personal pm2.5 samples and continuous geolocation (gps) data for 213 predominantly hispanic/latina pregnant women in their 3rd trimester in los angeles, ca. we also collected questionnaires and modeled outdoor air pollution and meteorology in their residential neighborhood. we calculated three gps-derived activity space measures of exposure to road networks, greenness (ndvi), parks, traffic volume, walkability, and outdoor pm2.5 and temperature. we used bivariate analyses to screen variables (gps-extracted exposures in activity spaces, individual characteristics, and residential neighborhood exposures) based on their relationship with personal, 48-h integrated pm2.5 concentrations. we then built a generalized linear model to explain the variability in personal pm2.5 exposure and identify key contributing factors. results: indoor pm2.5 sources, parity, and home ventilation were significantly associated with personal exposure. activity-space based exposure to roads was associated with significantly higher personal pm2.5 exposure, while greenness was associated with lower personal pm2.5 exposure (β = −3.09 μg/m3 per sd increase in ndvi, p-value = 0.018). the contribution of outdoor pm2.5 to personal exposure was positive but relatively lower (β = 2.05 μg/m3 per sd increase, p-value = 0.016) than exposures in activity spaces and the indoor environment. the final model explained 34% of the variability in personal pm2.5 concentrations. conclusions: our findings highlight the importance of activity spaces and the indoor environment on personal pm2.5 exposures of pregnant women living in los angeles, ca. this work also showcases the multiple, complex factors that contribute to total personal pm2.5 exposure. © 2022 elsevier inc. activity spaces; air pollution; gps; personal exposure; pm<sub>2.5</sub>; pregnancy air pollutants; air

associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). we aim to investigate susceptible windows of air pollution exposure and factors determining population vulnerability. methods: we ascertained gdm status in the prospective maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort from los angeles, california, usa. we calculated the relative risk of gdm by exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm10; pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air

urinary fluoride and child neurobehavior at age 36 months importance: recent studies in canadian and mexican populations suggest an association of higher prenatal fluoride exposure with poorer neurobehavioral development, but whether this association holds for us-based populations is unknown. objective: to examine associations of third trimester maternal urinary fluoride (muf) with child neurobehavior at age 3 years in the us. design, setting, and participants: this prospective cohort study utilized urine samples archived from 2017 to 2020 and neurobehavioral data assessed from 2020 to 2023 from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort, which consisted of predominately hispanic women residing in los angeles, california. cohort eligibility criteria at recruitment included being 18 years of age or older, less than 30 weeks' gestation, and a fluent english or spanish speaker. exclusion criteria included having a disability preventing participation or provision of informed consent, being hiv positive or incarcerated, and having a multiple gestation pregnancy. there were 263 mother-child pairs who completed the 3-year study visit. in this analysis, women who reported prenatal smoking were excluded. data analysis was conducted from october 2022 to march 2024. exposure: specific gravity-adjusted muf (mufsg), a biomarker of prenatal fluoride exposure. main outcomes and measures: neurobehavior was quantified using the preschool child behavior checklist (cbcl), which included composite scores for total problems, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. cbcl composite t scores range from 28 to 100. t scores from 60 to 63 are in the borderline clinical range, whereas scores above 63 are in the clinical range. linear and logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were conducted. results: a total of 229 mother-child pairs (mean [sd] maternal age, 29.45 [5.67] years; 116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; child behavior; child development; child, preschool; female; fluorides; humans; los angeles;

flame retardant chemicals and maternal depression during pregnancy background: depression substantially contributes to pregnancy-related morbidity, and pregnancy is increasingly recognized as a vulnerable window for exposure effects on maternal mental health. exposures to organophosphate esters (opes) are ubiquitous and may have neurotoxic effects; however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression; mixtures analysis; organophosphate esters adult; depression; environmental

fluoride levels and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california background: fluoride is ubiquitous in the united states (us); however, data on biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among us pregnant women are scarce. we examined specific gravity adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (mufsg) in relation to sociodemographic variables and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california. methods: participants were from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort. there were 293 and 490 women with mufsg measured during first and third trimesters, respectively. an intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of mufsg between trimesters. kruskal–wallis and mann-whitney u tests examined associations of mufsg with sociodemographic variables. covariate adjusted linear regression examined associations of mufsg with blood metals and specific gravity adjusted urine metals among a subsample of participants within and between trimesters. a false discovery rate (fdr) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. results: median (iqr) mufsg was 0.65 (0.5) mg/l and 0.8 (0.59) mg/l, during trimesters one and three respectively. during both trimesters, mufsg was higher among older participants, those with higher income, and white, non-hispanic participants than hispanic participants. mufsg was also higher for white, non-hispanic participants than for black, non-hispanic participants in trimester three, and for those with graduate training in trimester one. mufsg was negatively associated with blood mercury in trimester one and positively associated with blood lead in trimester three. mufsg was positively associated with various urinary metals, including antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc in trimesters one and/or three. conclusions: mufsg levels observed were comparable to those found in pregnant women in mexico and canada that have been associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. lower urinary fluoride levels among hispanic and non-hispanic black participants in madres compared to non-hispanic white participants may reflect lower tap water consumption or lower fluoride exposure from other sources. additional research is needed to examine whether mufsg levels observed among pregnant women in the us are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer nature. biomarkers; fluoride; hispanic women; los angeles; metals; pregnancy cadmium; female;

pregnancy to 2 years of age: a cohort study background: prenatal air pollution exposure may increase risk for childhood obesity. however, few studies have evaluated in utero growth measures and infant weight trajectories. this study will evaluate the associations of prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants with weight trajectories from the 3rd trimester through age 2 years. methods: we studied 490 pregnant women who were recruited from the maternal and development risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, which comprises a low-income, primarily hispanic population in los angeles, california. nitrogen dioxide (no2), particulate matter < 10 µm (pm10), particulate matter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), and ozone (o3) concentrations during pregnancy were estimated from regulatory air monitoring stations. fetal weight was estimated from maternal ultrasound records. infant/child weight measurements were extracted from medical records or measured during follow-up visits. piecewise spline models were used to assess the effect of air pollutants on weight, overall growth, and growth during each period. results: the mean (sd) prenatal exposure concentrations for no2, pm2.5, pm10, and o3 were 16.4 (2.9) ppb, 12.0 (1.1) μg/m3, 28.5 (4.7) μg/m3, and 26.2 (2.9) ppb, respectively. comparing an increase in prenatal average air pollutants from the 10th to the 90th percentile, the growth rate from the 3rd trimester to age 3 months was significantly increased (1.55% [95%ci 1.20%, 1.99%] for pm2.5 and 1.64% [95%ci 1.27%, 2.13%] for no2), the growth rate from age 6 months to age 2 years was significantly decreased (0.90% [95%ci 0.82%, 1.00%] for no2), and the attained weight at age 2 years was significantly lower (− 7.50% [95% ci − 13.57%, − 1.02%] for pm10 and − 7.00% [95% ci − 11.86%, − 1.88%] for no2). conclusions: prenatal ambient air pollution was associated with variable changes in growth rate and attained weight from the 3rd trimester to age 2 years. these results suggest continued public health benefits of reducing ambient air pollution levels, particularly in marginalized populations. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer

latino youth in los angeles background: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa)-axis dysfunction has been associated with a variety of mental health and cardio-metabolic disorders. while causal models of hpa-axis dysregulation have been largely focused on either pre-existing health conditions or psychosocial stress factors, recent evidence suggests a possible role for central nervous system activation via air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3) and particulate matter (pm). therefore, in an observational study of latino youth, we investigated if monthly ambient no2, o3, and pm with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 (pm2.5) exposure were associated with morning serum cortisol levels. methods: in this cross-sectional study, morning serum cortisol level was assessed after a supervised overnight fast in 203 overweight and obese latino children and adolescents (female/male: 88/115; mean age: 11.1 ± 1.7 years; pre-pubertal/pubertal/post-pubertal: 85/101/17; bmi z-score: 2.1 ± 0.4). cumulative concentrations of no2, o3 and pm2.5 were spatially interpolated at the residential addresses based on measurements from community monitors up to 12 months prior to testing. single and multi-pollutant linear effects models were used to test the cumulative monthly lag effects of no2, o3, and pm2.5 on morning serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, sex, seasonality, social position, pubertal status, and body fat percent by dexa. results: single and multi-pollutant models showed that higher o3 exposure (derived from maximum 8-h exposure windows) in the prior 1–7 months was associated with higher serum morning cortisol (p < 0.05) and longer term pm2.5 exposure (4–10 months) was associated with lower serum morning cortisol levels (p < 0.05). stratification by pubertal status showed associations in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal and post-pubertal children. single, but not multi-pollutant, models showed that higher no2 over the 4–10 month exposure period associated with lower morning serum cortisol (p < 0.05). conclusions: chronic ambient no2, o3 and pm2.5 differentially associate with hpa-axis dysfunction, a mechanism that may serve as an explanatory pathway in the relationship between ambient air pollution and metabolic health of youth living in polluted urban environments. further research that uncovers how ambient air pollutants may differentially contribute to hpa-axis dysfunction are warranted. © 2021, the author(s). ambient air pollution; children; hispanic; hpa-axis; ozone; particulate matter; serum cortisol adolescent; air

pollution and birth weight by maternal individual- and neighborhood-level stressors importance: fetal growth is precisely programmed and could be interrupted by environmental exposures during specific times during pregnancy. insights on potential sensitive windows of air pollution exposure in association with birth weight are needed. objective: to examine the association of sensitive windows of ambient air pollution exposure with birth weight and heterogeneity by individual- and neighborhood-level stressors. design, setting, and participants: data on a cohort of low-income hispanic women with singleton term pregnancy were collected from 2015 to 2021 in the ongoing maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors cohort in los angeles, california. exposures: daily ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (pm10) and aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-hour maximum ozone were assigned to residential locations. weekly averages from 12 weeks before conception to 36 gestational weeks were calculated. individual-level psychological stressor was measured by the perceived stress scale. neighborhood-level stressor was measured by the calenviroscreen 4.0. main outcomes and measures: sex-specific birth weight for gestational age z score (bwz). the associations between air pollutant and bwz were estimated using distributed lag models to identify sensitive windows of exposure, adjusting for maternal and meteorologic factors. we stratified the analyses by perceived stress scale and calenviroscreen 4.0. we converted the effect size estimation in bwz to grams to facilitate interpretation. results: the study included 628 pregnant women (mean [sd] age, 22.18 [5.92] years) and their newborns (mean [sd] bwz, -0.08 [1.03]). on average, an interquartile range (iqr) increase in pm2.5exposure during 4 to 22 gestational weeks was associated with a -9.5 g (95% ci, -10.4 to -8.6 g) change in birth weight. in stratified models, pm2.5from 4 to 24 gestational weeks was associated with a -34.0 g (95% ci, -35.7 to -32.4 g) change in birth weight and pm10from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -39.4 g (95% ci, -45.4 to -33.4) change in birth weight in the subgroup with high perceived stress scale and high calenviroscreen 4.0 scores. in this same group, no2from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -40.4 g (95% ci, -47.4 to -33.3 g) change in birth weight and, from 33 to 36 gestational weeks, a -117.6 g (95% ci, -125.3 to -83.7 g) change in birth weight. generally, there were no significant preconception windows for any air pollutants or ozone exposure with birth weight. conclusions and relevance: in this cohort study, early pregnancy to midpregnancy exposures to pm2.5, pm10, and no2were associated with lower birth weight, particularly for mothers experiencing higher perceived stress and living in a neighborhood with a high level of stressors from environmental pollution. © 2022 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; air pollutants; air pollution; birth weight; cohort studies; female; humans; infant, newborn; male; nitrogen

background: it is well documented that persons of color experience disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants, including air pollution, and have poorer pregnancy outcomes. this study assessed the critical windows of exposure to ambient air pollution on in utero fetal growth among structurally marginalized populations in urban los angeles. methods: participants (n = 281) from the larger ongoing madres pregnancy cohort study were included in this analysis. fetal growth outcomes were measured on average at 32 ± 2 weeks of gestation by a certified sonographer and included estimated fetal weight, abdominal circumference, head circumference, biparietal diameter and femur length. daily ambient air pollutant concentrations were estimated for four pollutants (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (pm2.5) and less than 10 µm (pm10) in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-h maximum ozone (o3)) at participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. weekly gestational averages were calculated from 12 weeks prior to conception to 32 weeks of gestation (44 total weeks), and their associations with growth outcomes were modeled using adjusted distributed lag models (dlms). results: participants were on average 29 years ± 6 old and predominately hispanic (82%). we identified a significant sensitive window of pm2.5 exposure (per iqr increase of 6 μg / m 3) between gestational weeks 4–16 for lower estimated fetal weight βaveraged4-16 = -8.7 g; 95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution;

potential air pollution exposure measurement error prior studies typically estimate air pollution exposure at places of residence only; however, people are likely to conduct daily activities at out-of-home locations. overlooking human mobility in exposure estimation can introduce measurement error in health analyses and may lead to ineffective public policies. we simulated travel mobility patterns for 100,784 residents of los angeles county and their exposure to outdoor pm2.5 on a typical weekday. we used k-means clustering via principal components analysis (pca) to subdivide subjects into seven travel behavior clusters and compared their mobility-based dynamic pm2.5 exposures to their residence-based static exposure using our previously developed spatiotemporal model. travel behavior correlated with exposure to outdoor pm2.5 and with the degree of pm2.5 exposure measurement error. workers with long commuting distance (and highest income) had the lowest dynamic pm2.5 exposure (8.1 μg/m3), while workers who relied on public transit (and were generally lower income) had the highest exposure (8.8 μg/m3). in general, lower income individuals lived in more polluted neighborhoods and took longer duration (but shorter distance) commutes to work locations with similarly elevated pm2.5 concentrations, while higher income individuals took longer distance commutes (similar duration) from less polluted residential to more polluted occupational neighborhoods. “worker” and frequent traveler clusters with highest mobility had the highest exposure measurement error, and the non-worker “stay-at-home” cluster and student clusters had the lowest. the extent of exposure measurement error generally correlated with pollution levels at the residential location and distance (less so duration) of travel away from the residential neighborhood. our results contribute to the literature on effects of travel behavior on exposure measurement error. the generated activity clusters combined with sociodemographic information provide additional information for researchers to understand which groups of people may be more challenging to model or predict their exposures accurately. © 2023 elsevier ltd clustering; exposure measurement error; pm<sub>2.5</sub>; travel behavior california; los angeles county; united states; air pollution; housing; k-means

the leading cause of mental health-related morbidity and affects twice as many women as men. hispanic/latina women in the us have unique risk factors for depression and they have lower utilization of mental health care services. identifying modifiable risk factors for maternal depression, such as ambient air pollution, is an urgent public health priority. we aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants was associated with maternal depression at 12 months after childbirth. methods: one hundred eighty predominantly low-income hispanic/latina women participating in the ongoing madres cohort study in los angeles, ca were followed from early pregnancy through 12 months postpartum through a series of phone questionnaires and in-person study visits. daily prenatal ambient pollutant estimates of nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and particulate matter (pm10 and pm2.5) were assigned to participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. exposures were averaged for each trimester and across pregnancy. the primary outcome measure was maternal depression at 12 months postpartum, as reported on the 20-item center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale. we classified each participant as depressed (n = 29) or not depressed (n = 151) based on the suggested cutoff of 16 or above (possible scores range from 0 to 60) and fitted logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. results: we found over a two-fold increased odds of depression at 12 months postpartum associated with second trimester no2 exposure (or = 2.63, 95% ci: 1.41–4.89) and pregnancy average no2 (or = 2.04, 95% ci: 1.13–3.69). higher second trimester pm2.5 exposure also was associated with increased depression at 12 months postpartum (or = 1.56, 95% ci: 1.01–2.42). the effect for second trimester pm10 was similar and was borderline significant (or = 1.58, 95% ci: 0.97–2.56). conclusions: in a low-income cohort consisting of primarily hispanic/latina women in urban los angeles, we found that prenatal ambient air pollution, especially mid-pregnancy no2 and pm2.5, increased the risk of depression at 12 months after childbirth. these results underscore the need to better understand the contribution of modifiable environmental risk factors during potentially critical exposure periods.

depression is the leading cause of mental health-related morbidity and affects twice as many women as men. hispanic/latina women in the us have unique risk factors for depression and they have lower utilization of mental health care services. identifying modifiable risk factors for maternal depression, such as ambient air pollution, is an urgent public health priority. we aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants was associated with maternal depression at 12 months after childbirth. methods: one hundred eighty predominantly low-income hispanic/latina women participating in the ongoing madres cohort study in los angeles, ca were followed from early pregnancy through 12 months postpartum through a series of phone questionnaires and in-person study visits. daily prenatal ambient pollutant estimates of nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and particulate matter (pm10 and pm2.5) were assigned to participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. exposures were averaged for each trimester and across pregnancy. the primary outcome measure was maternal depression at 12 months postpartum, as reported on the 20-item center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale. we classified each participant as depressed (n = 29) or not depressed (n = 151) based on the suggested cutoff of 16 or above (possible scores range from 0 to 60) and fitted logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. results: we found over a two-fold increased odds of depression at 12 months postpartum associated with second trimester no2 exposure (or = 2.63, 95% ci: 1.41–4.89) and pregnancy average no2 (or = 2.04, 95% ci: 1.13–3.69). higher second trimester pm2.5 exposure also was associated with increased depression at 12 months postpartum (or = 1.56, 95% ci: 1.01–2.42). the effect for second trimester pm10 was similar and was borderline significant (or = 1.58, 95% ci: 0.97–2.56). conclusions: in a low-income cohort consisting of primarily hispanic/latina women in urban los angeles, we found that prenatal ambient air pollution, especially mid-pregnancy no2 and pm2.5, increased the risk of depression at 12 months after childbirth. these results underscore the need to better understand the contribution of modifiable environmental risk factors during potentially critical exposure periods. © 2021, the author(s). air pollution; depression; environment; health disparities; madres; maternal health air pollutants; air pollution; cohort studies; depression; female; humans;

pregnancy to 2 years of age: a cohort study background: prenatal air pollution exposure may increase risk for childhood obesity. however, few studies have evaluated in utero growth measures and infant weight trajectories. this study will evaluate the associations of prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants with weight trajectories from the 3rd trimester through age 2 years. methods: we studied 490 pregnant women who were recruited from the maternal and development risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, which comprises a low-income, primarily hispanic population in los angeles, california. nitrogen dioxide (no2), particulate matter < 10 µm (pm10), particulate matter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), and ozone (o3) concentrations during pregnancy were estimated from regulatory air monitoring stations. fetal weight was estimated from maternal ultrasound records. infant/child weight measurements were extracted from medical records or measured during follow-up visits. piecewise spline models were used to assess the effect of air pollutants on weight, overall growth, and growth during each period. results: the mean (sd) prenatal exposure concentrations for no2, pm2.5, pm10, and o3 were 16.4 (2.9) ppb, 12.0 (1.1) μg/m3, 28.5 (4.7) μg/m3, and 26.2 (2.9) ppb, respectively. comparing an increase in prenatal average air pollutants from the 10th to the 90th percentile, the growth rate from the 3rd trimester to age 3 months was significantly increased (1.55% [95%ci 1.20%, 1.99%] for pm2.5 and 1.64% [95%ci 1.27%, 2.13%] for no2), the growth rate from age 6 months to age 2 years was significantly decreased (0.90% [95%ci 0.82%, 1.00%] for no2), and the attained weight at age 2 years was significantly lower (− 7.50% [95% ci − 13.57%, − 1.02%] for pm10 and − 7.00% [95% ci − 11.86%, − 1.88%] for no2). conclusions: prenatal ambient air pollution was associated with variable changes in growth rate and attained weight from the 3rd trimester to age 2 years. these results suggest continued public health benefits of reducing ambient air pollution levels, particularly in marginalized populations. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer

pollution is a hazardous contaminant, exposure to which has substantial consequences for health during critical periods, such as pregnancy. microrna (mirna) is an epigenetic mechanism that modulates transcriptome responses to the environment and has been found to change in reaction to air pollution exposure. the data are limited regarding extracellular-vesicle (ev) mirna variation associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy and in susceptible populations who may be disproportionately exposed. this study aimed to identify ev-mirna expression associated with ambient, residential exposure to pm2.5, pm10, no2, o3 and with traffic-related nox in 461 participants of the madres cohort, a low income, predominantly hispanic pregnancy cohort based in los angeles, ca. this study used residence-based modeled air pollution data as well as nanostring panels for evmirna extracted with qiagen exorneasy kits to evaluate 483 mirna in plasma in early and late pregnancy. average air pollution exposures were considered separately for 1-day, 1-week, and 8-week windows before blood collection in both early and late pregnancy. this study identified 63 and 66 evmirna significantly associated with pm2.5 and pm10, respectively, and 2 mirna associated with traffic-related nox (false discovery rate-adjusted p-value < .05). of 103 unique ev-mirna associated with pm, 92% were associated with lung conditions according to hmdd (human mirna disease database) evidence. in particular, ev-mirna previously identified with air pollution exposure also associated with pm2.5 and pm10 in this study were: mir-126, mir-16-5p, mir-187-3p, mir200b-3p, mir486-3p, and mir-582-3p. there were no significant differences in average exposures in early vs late pregnancy. significant ev-mirnas were only identified in late pregnancy with an 8-week exposure window, suggesting a vulnerable timeframe of exposure, rather than an acute response. these results describe a wide array of ev-mirna for which expression is affected by pm exposure and may be in part mediating the biological response to ambient air pollution, with potential for health implications in pregnant women and their children.

air pollution has been associated with gestational hypertension (gh) and preeclampsia, but susceptible windows of exposure and potential vulnerability by comorbidities, such as prenatal depression, remain unclear. methods: we ascertained gh and preeclampsia cases in a prospective pregnancy cohort in los angeles, ca daily levels of ambient particulate matters (with a diameter of ≤10 μm [pm10] or ≤2.5 μm [pm2.5]), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone were averaged for each week from 12 weeks preconception to 20 gestational weeks. we used distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows, adjusting for potential confounders. analyses were additionally stratified by probable prenatal depression to explore population vulnerability. results: among 619 participants, 60 developed preeclampsia and 42 developed gh. we identified a susceptible window for exposure to pm2.5from 1 week preconception to 11 weeks postconception: higher exposure (5 μg/m3) within this window was associated with an average of 8% (95% ci, 1%-15%) higher risk of gh. among participants with probable prenatal depression (n=179; 32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. ©

is precisely programmed and could be interrupted by environmental exposures during specific times during pregnancy. insights on potential sensitive windows of air pollution exposure in association with birth weight are needed. objective: to examine the association of sensitive windows of ambient air pollution exposure with birth weight and heterogeneity by individual- and neighborhood-level stressors. design, setting, and participants: data on a cohort of low-income hispanic women with singleton term pregnancy were collected from 2015 to 2021 in the ongoing maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors cohort in los angeles, california. exposures: daily ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (pm10) and aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-hour maximum ozone were assigned to residential locations. weekly averages from 12 weeks before conception to 36 gestational weeks were calculated. individual-level psychological stressor was measured by the perceived stress scale. neighborhood-level stressor was measured by the calenviroscreen 4.0. main outcomes and measures: sex-specific birth weight for gestational age z score (bwz). the associations between air pollutant and bwz were estimated using distributed lag models to identify sensitive windows of exposure, adjusting for maternal and meteorologic factors. we stratified the analyses by perceived stress scale and calenviroscreen 4.0. we converted the effect size estimation in bwz to grams to facilitate interpretation. results: the study included 628 pregnant women (mean [sd] age, 22.18 [5.92] years) and their newborns (mean [sd] bwz, -0.08 [1.03]). on average, an interquartile range (iqr) increase in pm2.5exposure during 4 to 22 gestational weeks was associated with a -9.5 g (95% ci, -10.4 to -8.6 g) change in birth weight. in stratified models, pm2.5from 4 to 24 gestational weeks was

subgroup with high perceived stress scale and high calenviroscreen 4.0 scores. in this same group, no2from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -40.4 g (95% ci, -47.4 to -33.3 g) change in birth weight and, from 33 to 36 gestational weeks, a -117.6 g (95% ci, -125.3 to -83.7 g) change in birth weight. generally, there were no significant preconception windows for any air pollutants or ozone exposure with birth weight. conclusions and relevance: in this cohort study, early pregnancy to midpregnancy exposures to pm2.5, pm10, and no2were associated with lower birth weight, particularly for mothers experiencing higher perceived stress and living in a neighborhood with a high level of stressors from environmental pollution. © 2022 american medical association. all rights

determinants of particulate matter peak exposures during pregnancy and early postpartum background: fine particulate matter (pm2.5) exposure is an important environmental risk for maternal and children's health, with peak exposures especially those derived from primary combustion hypothesized to pose greater risk. identifying pm2.5 peaks and their contributions to personal exposure remains challenging. this study measured personal pm2.5 exposure, characterized primary combustion peaks, and investigated their determinants during and after pregnancy and among hispanic women in los angeles, ca. methods: continuous personal pm2.5 exposure, global positioning system geolocation, and ecological momentary assessment surveys were collected from 63 women for 4 consecutive days in their 1st trimester, 3rd trimester and 4–6 months postpartum. based on the shape of pm2.5 time-series, primary combustion peaks were identified, characterized (number, duration, area under the curve [auc]), and linked with locations they occurred in. zero-inflated generalized mixed-effect models were used to examine the spatial and temporal determinants of pm2.5 peak exposures. results: a total of 490 pm2.5 peaks were identified from 618 person-days of monitoring. spending an additional minute at parks and open spaces was related to smaller (auc decreased 3.1 %, 95 % ci: 1.5 %–4.6 %) and shorter (duration decreased 1.7 %, 0.5 %–2.9 %) pm2.5 peak exposure. an additional minute in vehicular trips also related to smaller and shorter peak exposure (auc and duration decreased 2.5 %, 1.2 %–3.7 % and 1.8 %, 1.0 %–2.6 %, respectively). however, an additional minute at industrial locations was associated with greater number (3.6 %, 2.0 %–5.2 %), auc (1.6 %, 0.1 %–3.2 %) and duration (1.0 %, 0.0 %–2.1 %) of personal pm2.5 peak exposure. conclusions: this study demonstrates the potential to statistically identify exposure to primary combustion pm2.5 peaks and understand their determinants from personal monitoring data. results suggest that visits to parks and open spaces may minimize pm2.5 peak exposures, while visiting industrial locations may increase them in and around pregnancy. © 2024 fine particulate matter; microenvironment; peak exposures; personal exposure; primary combustion; time-activity ;maternal urinary fluoride and child neurobehavior at age 36 months importance: recent studies in canadian and mexican populations suggest an association of higher prenatal fluoride exposure with poorer neurobehavioral development, but whether this association holds for us-based populations is unknown. objective: to examine associations of third trimester maternal urinary fluoride (muf) with child neurobehavior at age 3 years in the us. design, setting, and participants: this prospective cohort study utilized urine samples archived from 2017 to 2020 and neurobehavioral data assessed from 2020 to 2023 from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort, which consisted of predominately hispanic women residing in los angeles, california. cohort eligibility criteria at recruitment included being 18 years of age or older, less than 30 weeks' gestation, and a fluent english or spanish speaker. exclusion criteria included having a disability preventing participation or provision of informed consent, being hiv positive or incarcerated, and having a multiple gestation pregnancy. there were 263 mother-child pairs who completed the 3-year study visit. in this analysis, women who reported prenatal smoking were excluded. data analysis was conducted from october 2022 to march 2024. exposure: specific gravity-adjusted muf (mufsg), a biomarker of prenatal fluoride exposure. main outcomes and measures: neurobehavior was quantified using the preschool child behavior checklist (cbcl), which included composite scores for total problems, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. cbcl composite t scores range from 28 to 100. t scores from 60 to 63 are in the borderline clinical range, whereas scores above 63 are in the clinical range. linear and logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were conducted. results: a total of 229 mother-child pairs (mean [sd] maternal age, 29.45 [5.67] years; 116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american

affects fetal growth in the predominately hispanic madres cohort background: it is well documented that persons of color experience disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants, including air pollution, and have poorer pregnancy outcomes. this study assessed the critical windows of exposure to ambient air pollution on in utero fetal growth among structurally marginalized populations in urban los angeles. methods: participants (n = 281) from the larger ongoing madres pregnancy cohort study were included in this analysis. fetal growth outcomes were measured on average at 32 ± 2 weeks of gestation by a certified sonographer and included estimated fetal weight, abdominal circumference, head circumference, biparietal diameter and femur length. daily ambient air pollutant concentrations were estimated for four pollutants (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (pm2.5) and less than 10 µm (pm10) in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-h maximum ozone (o3)) at participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. weekly gestational averages were calculated from 12 weeks prior to conception to 32 weeks of gestation (44 total weeks), and their associations with growth outcomes were modeled using adjusted distributed lag models (dlms). results: participants were on average 29 years ± 6 old and predominately hispanic (82%). we identified a significant sensitive window of pm2.5 exposure (per iqr increase of 6 μg / m 3) between gestational weeks 4–16 for lower estimated fetal weight βaveraged4-16 = -8.7 g; 95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution; dlm; fetal growth; health disparities; particulate matter; pregnancy air pollution; cohort studies; environmental exposure;

biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among us pregnant women are scarce. we examined specific gravity adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (mufsg) in relation to sociodemographic variables and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california. methods: participants were from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort. there were 293 and 490 women with mufsg measured during first and third trimesters, respectively. an intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of mufsg between trimesters. kruskal–wallis and mann-whitney u tests examined associations of mufsg with sociodemographic variables. covariate adjusted linear regression examined associations of mufsg with blood metals and specific gravity adjusted urine metals among a subsample of participants within and between trimesters. a false discovery rate (fdr) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. results: median (iqr) mufsg was 0.65 (0.5) mg/l and 0.8 (0.59) mg/l, during trimesters one and three respectively. during both trimesters, mufsg was higher among older participants, those with higher income, and white, non-hispanic participants than hispanic participants. mufsg was also higher for white, non-hispanic participants than for black, non-hispanic participants in trimester three, and for those with graduate training in trimester one. mufsg was negatively associated with blood mercury in trimester one and positively associated with blood lead in trimester three. mufsg was positively associated with various urinary metals, including antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc in trimesters one and/or three. conclusions: mufsg levels observed were comparable to those found in pregnant women in mexico and canada that have been associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. lower urinary fluoride levels among hispanic and non-hispanic black participants in madres compared to non-hispanic white participants may reflect lower tap water consumption or lower fluoride exposure from other sources. additional research is needed to examine whether mufsg levels observed among pregnant women in the us are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer nature. biomarkers; fluoride; hispanic women; los angeles; metals; pregnancy

oil development background: modern oil development frequently occurs in close proximity to human populations. los angeles, california is home to the largest urban oil field in the country with thousands of active oil and gas wells in very close proximity to homes, schools and parks, yet few studies have investigated potential health impacts. the neighborhoods along the las cienagas oil fields are situated in south la, densely populated by predominantly low-income black and latinx families, many of whom are primarily spanish-speakers. methods: a cross-sectional community-based study was conducted between january 2017 and august 2019 among residents living <1000 m from two oil wells (one active, one idle) in the las cienagas oil field. we collected self-reported acute health symptoms and measured fev1 (forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation) and fvc (forced vital capacity). we related lung function measures to distance and direction from an oil and gas development site using generalized linear models adjusted for covariates. results: a total of 961 residents from two neighborhoods participated, the majority of whom identify as latinx. participants near active oil development reported significantly higher prevalence of wheezing, eye and nose irritation, sore throat and dizziness in the past 2 weeks. among 747 valid spirometry tests, we observe that living near (less than 200 m) of oil operations was associated with, on average, −112 ml lower fev1 (95% ci: −213, −10) and −128 ml lower fvc (95% ci: −252, −5) compared to residents living more than 200 m from the sites after adjustments for covariates, including age, sex, height, proximity to freeway, asthma status and smoking status. when accounting for predominant wind direction and proximity, we observe that residents living downwind and less than 200 m from oil operations have, on average, −414 ml lower fev1 (95% ci: −636, −191) and −400 ml lower fvc (95% ci: −652, −147) compared to residents living upwind and more than 200 m from the wells. conclusions: living nearby and downwind of urban oil and gas development sites is associated with lower lung function among residents, which may contribute to environmental health disparities. © 2021 elsevier inc. environmental justice; oil drilling; respiratory health; urban health cross-sectional studies; forced

gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). we aim to investigate susceptible windows of air pollution exposure and factors determining population vulnerability. methods: we ascertained gdm status in the prospective maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort from los angeles, california, usa. we calculated the relative risk of gdm by exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm10; pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

retardant chemicals and maternal depression during pregnancy background: depression substantially contributes to pregnancy-related morbidity, and pregnancy is increasingly recognized as a vulnerable window for exposure effects on maternal mental health. exposures to organophosphate esters (opes) are ubiquitous and may have neurotoxic effects; however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression; mixtures analysis; organophosphate esters adult; depression; environmental

diaries to characterize stressors and acute health symptoms in an environmental justice neighborhood low-income communities and communities of color face multiple, cumulative environmental and social burdens. methods development in environmental justice research has largely focused on spatial and quantitative approaches. less attention has been paid to developing methodologies that help collect information on everyday stressors and quality of life experiences for residents in overburdened communities. mixed methods approaches can be one way to structure study designs that help consider how residents experience environmental and socioeconomic impacts in a localized community context. in neighborhoods burdened by cumulative stressors, traditional cross-sectional epidemiological research designs can also be challenging, as well as limited or narrow in their application. however, repeat sampling of measures within a vulnerable population can approach a quasi-experimental design and help consider variations within residents in a single neighborhood as well as better parse relationships between exposures and outcomes. through a community-academic partnership with university partners, local community partners, and a local promotores de salud (community health workers) network, we pilot tested a novel mobile daily diary approach in both english and spanish in an urban, predominantly immigrant community in south los angeles as a potential method to collect information on daily stress, environmental quality, and health status/symptoms. we collected resident responses via a once per day 7-day sms/text messaging survey. we sought to gather granular data on daily resident experiences of air pollution and environmental hazards. residents reported acute health symptoms and stressors, with repeat measures demonstrating how residents might rank, categorize, or cope with stressors. we find that residents in environmental justice communities record variation in their daily diary responses and document changes in environmental quality, stressors, and odors. refining this type of method could enable a more rigorous examination of co-occurrences of environmental quality and acute health symptoms. this approach supports the inclusion of residents in the research process and helps more systematically integrate open-ended environmental health relevant data in environmental justice efforts. used with measured data such as air monitoring or health measures, mixed methods generated data can help support efforts that aim to alleviate sources of daily stress, alongside efforts to reduce overall pollution burdens. mobile daily diaries can be one way to capture variable responses to environmental quality, acute health symptoms, and stressors. © 2022

air pollution is associated with acute pediatric asthma exacerba-tions, including reduced lung function, rescue medication usage, and increased symptoms; however, most studies are limited in investigating longitudinal changes in these acute effects. this study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. methods: we conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8–16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. we deployed the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit developed in the los angeles prisms center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (gps), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. hourly ambient (pm2.5, nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (nox) and pm2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. we used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (pef), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. results: participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4–16.8) with mean (sd) morning %predicted fev1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and pef of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use. participants reported chest tightness, wheeze, trouble breathing, and cough symptoms on 36.4%, 17.5%, 32.3%, and 42.9%, respectively (n = 217 person-days). one sd increase in previous day o3 exposure was associated with reduced morning (beta [95% ci]: −4.11 [−6.86, −1.36]), evening (−2.65 [−5.19, −0.10]) and daily average %predicted fev1 (−3.45 [−6.42, −0.47]). daily (lag 0) exposure to traffic-related pm2.5 exposure was associated with reduced morning %predicted pef (−3.97 [−7.69, −0.26]) and greater odds of “feeling scared of trouble breathing” symptom (odds ratio [95% ci]: 1.83 [1.03, 3.24]). exposure to ambient o3, nox, and no was significantly associated with increased rescue inhaler use (rate ratio [95% ci]: o3 1.52 [1.02, 2.27], nox 1.61 [1.23, 2.11], no 1.80 [1.37, 2.35]). conclusions: we found significant associations of air pollution exposure with lung function, rescue inhaler use, and “feeling scared of trouble breathing.” our study demonstrates the potential of informatics and wearable sensor technologies at collecting highly resolved, contextual, and personal exposure data for understanding acute pediatric asthma triggers. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. gps; mobile health; pediatric asthma;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

these 3 agents were correlated (r2 = 0.45–0.77)]. agents related to gasoline production or combustion were related to increased breast cancer risk [benzene (hr = 1.32, 95% ci 1.24, 1.41), ethylbenzene (hr = 1.20, 95% ci 1.13–1.28), toluene (hr = 1.29, 95% ci 1.20–1.38), naphthalene (hr = 1.11, 95% ci 1.02–2.22), acrolein (hr = 2.26, 95% ci 1.92, 2.65)]. higher hazard ratios were observed in african americans and whites compared to other racial and ethnic groups (p-heterogeneity <0.05 for traffic-related air toxics, acrolein, and vinyl acetate). conclusions: our findings suggest that specific toxic air pollutants may be associated with increase breast cancer risk. © 2024 the authors 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane;

1900 ce (rates obtained were 9 and 12 mg cm-2 yr-1). the δ13corg profiles show a relatively constant value where laminations are present, suggesting that the change in sediment accumulation rate is not accompanied by a change in organic carbon sources to the basin. the increase in sedimentation rate towards the recent occurs at about the time previous studies predicted an increase in siltation and the demise of a shelly shelf benthic fauna on the smb shelf. x-radiographs show finely laminated sediments in the deepest part of the basin only, with centimeter-scale layering of sediments or no layering whatsoever in shallower parts of the smb basin. the absence of finely laminated sediments in cores muc 10 (893 m) and muc 3 (777 m) suggests that the rate at which anoxia is spreading has not increased appreciably since cores were last analyzed in the 1980s. based on core top data collected during the past half century, sedimentary dynamics within smb have changed minimally during the last 40 years. specifically, mass accumulation rates, laminated sediment fabric, extent of bioturbation and % corg have not changed. the only parameter that appeared to have changed in the last 450 years was the mar, with an apparent > 50 % increase occurring between &tild; 1850 ce and the early 1900s. the post-1900 ce constancy of sedimentation through a period of massive urbanization in los angeles is surprising. © author(s) 2020.  california; los angeles [california];

seasonal variation; sediment core; sedimentation rate; urban area; urbanization;quantification of fossil fuel co2 from combined co, 13co2 and δ14co2 observations we present a new method for partitioning observed co2 enhancements (co2xs) into fossil and biospheric fractions (cff and cbio) based on measurements of co and 13co2, complemented by flask-based δ14co2 measurements. this method additionally partitions the fossil fraction into natural gas and petroleum fractions (when coal combustion is insignificant). although here we apply the method only to discrete flask air measurements, the advantage of this method (co-and 13co2-based method) is that co2xs partitioning can be applied at high frequency when continuous measurements of co and 13co2 are available. high-frequency partitioning of co2xs into cff and cbio has already been demonstrated using continuous measurements of co (co-based method) and δ14co2 measurements from flask air samples. we find that the uncertainty in cff estimated from the co-and 13co2-based method averages 3.2 ppm (23 % of the mean cff of 14.2 ppm estimated directly from δ14co2), which is significantly less than the co-based method which has an average uncertainty of 4.8 ppm (34 % of the mean cff). using measurements of co, 13co2 and δ14co2 from flask air samples at three sites in the greater los angeles (la) region, we find large contributions of biogenic sources that vary by season. on a monthly average, the biogenic signal accounts for-14 to +25 % of co2xs with larger and positive contributions in winter and smaller and negative contributions in summer due to net respiration and net photosynthesis, respectively. partitioning cff into petroleum and natural gas combustion fractions reveals that the largest contribution of natural gas combustion generally occurs in summer, which is likely related to increased electricity generation in la power plants for air-conditioning.  © copyright:   air conditioning;

∼30 km east of downtown los angeles. we found that an average pavement albedo increase of 0.18 (from 0.08 to 0.26) corresponded to maximum neighborhood averaged t surface and t air reductions of 5 °c and 0.2 °c, respectively. maximum t surface reductions were observed in the afternoon, while minimum reductions of 0.9 °c were observed in the morning. t air reductions were detected at 12:00 local standard time (lst), and from 20:00 lst to 22:59 lst, suggesting that cool pavement decreases t air during the daytime as well as in the evening. an average albedo reduction of 30% corresponded to a ∼1 °c reduction in the t surface cooling efficacy. although we present here the first measured t air reductions due to cool pavement, we emphasize that the tradeoffs between t air reductions and reflected shortwave radiation increases are still unclear and warrant further investigation in order to holistically assess the efficacy of cool pavements, especially with regards to pedestrian thermal comfort.  © 2022 the author(s). published by iop publishing ltd. climate change;

however, data on biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among us pregnant women are scarce. we examined specific gravity adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (mufsg) in relation to sociodemographic variables and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california. methods: participants were from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort. there were 293 and 490 women with mufsg measured during first and third trimesters, respectively. an intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of mufsg between trimesters. kruskal–wallis and mann-whitney u tests examined associations of mufsg with sociodemographic variables. covariate adjusted linear regression examined associations of mufsg with blood metals and specific gravity adjusted urine metals among a subsample of participants within and between trimesters. a false discovery rate (fdr) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. results: median (iqr) mufsg was 0.65 (0.5) mg/l and 0.8 (0.59) mg/l, during trimesters one and three respectively. during both trimesters, mufsg was higher among older participants, those with higher income, and white, non-hispanic participants than hispanic participants. mufsg was also higher for white, non-hispanic participants than for black, non-hispanic participants in trimester three, and for those with graduate training in trimester one. mufsg was negatively associated with blood mercury in trimester one and positively associated with blood lead in trimester three. mufsg was positively associated with various urinary metals, including antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc in trimesters one and/or three. conclusions: mufsg levels observed were comparable to those found in pregnant women in mexico and canada that have been associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. lower urinary fluoride levels among hispanic and non-hispanic black participants in madres compared to non-hispanic white participants may reflect lower tap water consumption or lower fluoride exposure from other sources. additional research is needed to examine whether mufsg levels observed among pregnant women in the us are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer nature. biomarkers;

116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.  aerosols;

fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤200 nm) and cch secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (bcas) in a murine model to produce white matter injury. based on other air pollution interac-tions, we predicted synergies of npm with bcas. methods: npm was collected using a particle sampler near a los angeles, california, freeway. mice were exposed to 10 wk of reaerosolized npm or filtered air (fa) for 150 h. cch was induced by bcas surgery. mice (c57bl/6j males) were randomized to four exposure paradigms: a) fa, b) npm, c) fa + bcas, and d) npm + bcas. behavioral outcomes, white matter injury, glial cell activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed. results: the joint npm + bcas group exhibited synergistic effects on white matter injury (2.3× the additive npm and fa + bcas scores) with greater loss of corpus callosum volume on t2 magnetic resonance imaging (mri) (30% smaller than fa group). histochemical analyses suggested potential microglial-specific inflammatory responses with synergistic effects on corpus callosum c5 immunofluorescent density and whole brain ni-trate concentrations (2.1× and 3.9× the additive npm and fa + bcas effects, respectively) in the joint exposure group. transcriptomic responses (rna-seq) showed greater impact of npm + bcas than individual additive effects, consistent with changes in proinflammatory pathways. although npm exposure alone did not alter working memory, the npm + bcas cohort demonstrated impaired working memory when compared to the fa + bcas group. discussion: our data suggest that npm and cch contribute to white matter injury in a synergistic manner in a mouse model. adverse neurological effects may be aggravated in a susceptible population exposed to air pollution. © 2021, public health services, us dept of health and human services. all rights reserved.  air pollution;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

and effect modification by prenatal depression background: air pollution has been associated with gestational hypertension (gh) and preeclampsia, but susceptible windows of exposure and potential vulnerability by comorbidities, such as prenatal depression, remain unclear. methods: we ascertained gh and preeclampsia cases in a prospective pregnancy cohort in los angeles, ca daily levels of ambient particulate matters (with a diameter of ≤10 μm [pm10] or ≤2.5 μm [pm2.5]), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone were averaged for each week from 12 weeks preconception to 20 gestational weeks. we used distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows, adjusting for potential confounders. analyses were additionally stratified by probable prenatal depression to explore population vulnerability. results: among 619 participants, 60 developed preeclampsia and 42 developed gh. we identified a susceptible window for exposure to pm2.5from 1 week preconception to 11 weeks postconception: higher exposure (5 μg/m3) within this window was associated with an average of 8% (95% ci, 1%-15%) higher risk of gh. among participants with probable prenatal depression (n=179; 32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution; depression; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; preeclampsia; pregnancy

angeles, california background: fluoride is ubiquitous in the united states (us); however, data on biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among us pregnant women are scarce. we examined specific gravity adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (mufsg) in relation to sociodemographic variables and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california. methods: participants were from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort. there were 293 and 490 women with mufsg measured during first and third trimesters, respectively. an intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of mufsg between trimesters. kruskal–wallis and mann-whitney u tests examined associations of mufsg with sociodemographic variables. covariate adjusted linear regression examined associations of mufsg with blood metals and specific gravity adjusted urine metals among a subsample of participants within and between trimesters. a false discovery rate (fdr) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. results: median (iqr) mufsg was 0.65 (0.5) mg/l and 0.8 (0.59) mg/l, during trimesters one and three respectively. during both trimesters, mufsg was higher among older participants, those with higher income, and white, non-hispanic participants than hispanic participants. mufsg was also higher for white, non-hispanic participants than for black, non-hispanic participants in trimester three, and for those with graduate training in trimester one. mufsg was negatively associated with blood mercury in trimester one and positively associated with blood lead in trimester three. mufsg was positively associated with various urinary metals, including antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc in trimesters one and/or three. conclusions: mufsg levels observed were comparable to those found in pregnant women in mexico and canada that have been associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. lower urinary fluoride levels among hispanic and non-hispanic black participants in madres compared to non-hispanic white participants may reflect lower tap water consumption or lower fluoride exposure from other sources. additional research is needed to examine whether mufsg levels observed among pregnant women in the us are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2023,

associated with acute pediatric asthma exacerba-tions, including reduced lung function, rescue medication usage, and increased symptoms; however, most studies are limited in investigating longitudinal changes in these acute effects. this study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. methods: we conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8–16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. we deployed the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit developed in the los angeles prisms center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (gps), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. hourly ambient (pm2.5, nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (nox) and pm2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. we used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (pef), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. results: participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4–16.8) with mean (sd) morning %predicted fev1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and pef of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use. participants reported chest tightness, wheeze, trouble breathing, and cough symptoms on 36.4%, 17.5%, 32.3%, and 42.9%, respectively (n = 217 person-days). one sd increase in previous day o3 exposure was associated with reduced morning (beta [95% ci]: −4.11 [−6.86, −1.36]), evening (−2.65 [−5.19, −0.10]) and daily average %predicted fev1 (−3.45 [−6.42, −0.47]). daily (lag 0) exposure to traffic-related pm2.5 exposure was associated with reduced morning %predicted pef (−3.97 [−7.69, −0.26]) and greater odds of “feeling scared of trouble breathing” symptom (odds ratio [95% ci]: 1.83 [1.03, 3.24]). exposure to ambient o3, nox, and no was significantly associated with increased rescue inhaler use (rate ratio [95% ci]: o3 1.52 [1.02, 2.27], nox 1.61 [1.23, 2.11], no 1.80 [1.37, 2.35]). conclusions: we found significant associations of air pollution exposure with lung function, rescue inhaler use, and “feeling scared of trouble breathing.” our study demonstrates the potential of informatics and wearable sensor technologies at collecting highly resolved, contextual, and personal exposure data for understanding acute pediatric asthma triggers. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. gps; mobile health; pediatric asthma; personal air pollution; prisms; sensors

background: arsenic (as) is a contaminant of top public health concern, due to its range of detrimental health effects. arsenic exposure has not been well-characterized among the us hispanic populations and has been particularly understudied in this population during pregnancy. methods: as part of the madres ongoing pregnancy cohort of predominantly lower-income, hispanic women in los angeles, ca, we examined levels of maternal first trimester urinary as, including total as and as metabolites (inorganic (ias), monomethylated (mma) and dimethylated as (dma)), in relation to participant demographics, lifestyle characteristics, and rice/seafood consumption, to identify factors that may influence as exposure and its metabolites during pregnancy (n = 241). results: total as concentrations ranged from low to high (0.8–506.2 μg/l, mean: 9.0 μg/l, sd: 32.9) in our study population. foreign-born hispanic women had 8.6% higher %dma (95% ci: 3.3%, 13.9%) and −7.7% lower %ias (95% ci: −12.6%, −2.9%) than non-hispanic women. a similar trend was observed for us-born hispanic women. in addition, maternal age was associated with 0.4% higher %ias (95% ci: 0.1%, 0.6%) and 0.4% lower %dma (95% ci: −0.7%, −0.1%) per year, which may indicate poor as methylation capacity. conclusion: individual factors may predict as exposure and metabolism in pregnancy, and in turn, greater risk of adverse health effects. © 2020, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature america, inc. arsenic; cohort; environment; health disparities; hispanic; pregnancy arsenic;

increasingly recognized as a vulnerable window for exposure effects on maternal mental health. exposures to organophosphate esters (opes) are ubiquitous and may have neurotoxic effects; however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression; mixtures analysis; organophosphate esters

and prenatal exposure to air pollutants and risk of gestational diabetes in the madres prospective pregnancy cohort study background: air pollution has been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). we aim to investigate susceptible windows of air pollution exposure and factors determining population vulnerability. methods: we ascertained gdm status in the prospective maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort from los angeles, california, usa. we calculated the relative risk of gdm by exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm10; pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution; depression; gestational

neurobehavior at age 36 months importance: recent studies in canadian and mexican populations suggest an association of higher prenatal fluoride exposure with poorer neurobehavioral development, but whether this association holds for us-based populations is unknown. objective: to examine associations of third trimester maternal urinary fluoride (muf) with child neurobehavior at age 3 years in the us. design, setting, and participants: this prospective cohort study utilized urine samples archived from 2017 to 2020 and neurobehavioral data assessed from 2020 to 2023 from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort, which consisted of predominately hispanic women residing in los angeles, california. cohort eligibility criteria at recruitment included being 18 years of age or older, less than 30 weeks' gestation, and a fluent english or spanish speaker. exclusion criteria included having a disability preventing participation or provision of informed consent, being hiv positive or incarcerated, and having a multiple gestation pregnancy. there were 263 mother-child pairs who completed the 3-year study visit. in this analysis, women who reported prenatal smoking were excluded. data analysis was conducted from october 2022 to march 2024. exposure: specific gravity-adjusted muf (mufsg), a biomarker of prenatal fluoride exposure. main outcomes and measures: neurobehavior was quantified using the preschool child behavior checklist (cbcl), which included composite scores for total problems, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. cbcl composite t scores range from 28 to 100. t scores from 60 to 63 are in the borderline clinical range, whereas scores above 63 are in the clinical range. linear and logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were conducted. results: a total of 229 mother-child pairs (mean [sd] maternal age, 29.45 [5.67] years; 116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; child behavior; child development; child, preschool; female; fluorides; humans; los angeles; male; maternal

particulate matter peak exposures during pregnancy and early postpartum background: fine particulate matter (pm2.5) exposure is an important environmental risk for maternal and children's health, with peak exposures especially those derived from primary combustion hypothesized to pose greater risk. identifying pm2.5 peaks and their contributions to personal exposure remains challenging. this study measured personal pm2.5 exposure, characterized primary combustion peaks, and investigated their determinants during and after pregnancy and among hispanic women in los angeles, ca. methods: continuous personal pm2.5 exposure, global positioning system geolocation, and ecological momentary assessment surveys were collected from 63 women for 4 consecutive days in their 1st trimester, 3rd trimester and 4–6 months postpartum. based on the shape of pm2.5 time-series, primary combustion peaks were identified, characterized (number, duration, area under the curve [auc]), and linked with locations they occurred in. zero-inflated generalized mixed-effect models were used to examine the spatial and temporal determinants of pm2.5 peak exposures. results: a total of 490 pm2.5 peaks were identified from 618 person-days of monitoring. spending an additional minute at parks and open spaces was related to smaller (auc decreased 3.1 %, 95 % ci: 1.5 %–4.6 %) and shorter (duration decreased 1.7 %, 0.5 %–2.9 %) pm2.5 peak exposure. an additional minute in vehicular trips also related to smaller and shorter peak exposure (auc and duration decreased 2.5 %, 1.2 %–3.7 % and 1.8 %, 1.0 %–2.6 %, respectively). however, an additional minute at industrial locations was associated with greater number (3.6 %, 2.0 %–5.2 %), auc (1.6 %, 0.1 %–3.2 %) and duration (1.0 %, 0.0 %–2.1 %) of personal pm2.5 peak exposure. conclusions: this study demonstrates the potential to statistically identify exposure to primary combustion pm2.5 peaks and understand their determinants from personal monitoring data. results suggest that visits to parks and open spaces may minimize pm2.5 peak exposures, while visiting industrial locations may increase them in and around pregnancy. © 2024 fine particulate

participating in the echo program background: a growing number of studies have identified both toxic and essential metals which influence fetal growth. however, most studies have conducted single-cohort analyses, which are often limited by narrow exposure ranges, and evaluated metals individually. the objective of the current study was to conduct an environmental mixture analysis of metal impacts on fetal growth, pooling data from three geographically and demographically diverse cohorts in the united states participating in the environmental influences on child health outcomes program. methods: the pooled sample (n = 1,002) included participants from the madres, nhbcs, and protect cohorts. associations between seven metals (antimony, cadmium, cobalt, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, tin) measured in maternal urine samples collected during pregnancy (median: 16.0 weeks gestation) and birth weight for gestational age z-scores (bw for ga) were investigated using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). models were also stratified by cohort and infant sex to investigate possible heterogeneity. chromium and uranium concentrations fell below the limits of detection for most participants and were evaluated separately as binary variables using pooled linear regression models. results: in the pooled bkmr analysis, antimony, mercury, and tin were inversely and linearly associated with bw for ga, while a positive linear association was identified for nickel. the inverse association between antimony and bw for ga was observed in both males and females and for all three cohorts but was strongest for madres, a predominantly low-income hispanic cohort in los angeles. a reverse j-shaped association was identified between cobalt and bw for ga, which was driven by female infants. pooled associations were null for cadmium, chromium, molybdenum, and uranium, and bkmr did not identify potential interactions between metal pairs. conclusions: findings suggest that antimony, an understudied metalloid, may adversely impact fetal growth. cohort- and/or sex-dependent associations were identified for many of the metals, which merit additional investigation. © 2022

on personal pm2.5 exposures in the madres cohort background: in-utero exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (pm2.5) is associated with low birth weight and health risks later in life. pregnant women are mobile and locations they spend time in contribute to their personal pm2.5 exposures. therefore, it is important to understand how mobility and exposures encountered within activity spaces contribute to personal pm2.5 exposures during pregnancy. methods: we collected 48-h integrated personal pm2.5 samples and continuous geolocation (gps) data for 213 predominantly hispanic/latina pregnant women in their 3rd trimester in los angeles, ca. we also collected questionnaires and modeled outdoor air pollution and meteorology in their residential neighborhood. we calculated three gps-derived activity space measures of exposure to road networks, greenness (ndvi), parks, traffic volume, walkability, and outdoor pm2.5 and temperature. we used bivariate analyses to screen variables (gps-extracted exposures in activity spaces, individual characteristics, and residential neighborhood exposures) based on their relationship with personal, 48-h integrated pm2.5 concentrations. we then built a generalized linear model to explain the variability in personal pm2.5 exposure and identify key contributing factors. results: indoor pm2.5 sources, parity, and home ventilation were significantly associated with personal exposure. activity-space based exposure to roads was associated with significantly higher personal pm2.5 exposure, while greenness was associated with lower personal pm2.5 exposure (β = −3.09 μg/m3 per sd increase in ndvi, p-value = 0.018). the contribution of outdoor pm2.5 to personal exposure was positive but relatively lower (β = 2.05 μg/m3 per sd increase, p-value = 0.016) than exposures in activity spaces and the indoor environment. the final model explained 34% of the variability in personal pm2.5 concentrations. conclusions: our findings highlight the importance of activity spaces and the indoor environment on personal pm2.5 exposures of pregnant women living in los angeles, ca. this work also showcases the multiple, complex factors that contribute to total personal pm2.5 exposure. © 2022 elsevier inc. activity spaces; air pollution; gps; personal exposure; pm<sub>2.5</sub>; pregnancy air

consequences for health during critical periods, such as pregnancy. microrna (mirna) is an epigenetic mechanism that modulates transcriptome responses to the environment and has been found to change in reaction to air pollution exposure. the data are limited regarding extracellular-vesicle (ev) mirna variation associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy and in susceptible populations who may be disproportionately exposed. this study aimed to identify ev-mirna expression associated with ambient, residential exposure to pm2.5, pm10, no2, o3 and with traffic-related nox in 461 participants of the madres cohort, a low income, predominantly hispanic pregnancy cohort based in los angeles, ca. this study used residence-based modeled air pollution data as well as nanostring panels for evmirna extracted with qiagen exorneasy kits to evaluate 483 mirna in plasma in early and late pregnancy. average air pollution exposures were considered separately for 1-day, 1-week, and 8-week windows before blood collection in both early and late pregnancy. this study identified 63 and 66 evmirna significantly associated with pm2.5 and pm10, respectively, and 2 mirna associated with traffic-related nox (false discovery rate-adjusted p-value < .05). of 103 unique ev-mirna associated with pm, 92% were associated with lung conditions according to hmdd (human mirna disease database) evidence. in particular, ev-mirna previously identified with air pollution exposure also associated with pm2.5 and pm10 in this study were: mir-126, mir-16-5p, mir-187-3p, mir200b-3p, mir486-3p, and mir-582-3p. there were no significant differences in average exposures in early vs late pregnancy. significant ev-mirnas were only identified in late pregnancy with an 8-week exposure window, suggesting a vulnerable timeframe of exposure, rather than an acute response. these results describe a wide array of ev-mirna for which expression is affected by pm exposure and may be in part mediating the biological response to ambient air pollution, with potential for health implications in pregnant women and their children. © the author(s) 2024. published by oxford university press. air

environmental health and risks among latina mothers in urban los angeles, california, usa background: environmental exposures during pregnancy and early childhood can have acute and chronic adverse health impacts. as minoritized populations are more likely to reside in areas with greater pollution, it is important to understand their views and lived experiences to inform action. the purpose of this community-driven qualitative research study was to understand how urban latina mothers in los angeles county, california perceived environmental health and risks. methods: we conducted semi-structured individual interviews with latina pregnant women and mothers of young children, recruited through existing collaborations with community organizations. interviews conducted in either english or spanish and were coded inductively according to a modified grounded theory approach. results: thirty-six latina mothers completed interviews between august–october 2016. participants lived primarily in low-income communities of south-central los angeles and east los angeles. we identified three major themes based on the participants’ responses during interviews: defining the environment, environment & health risks, and social & political responsibility. women defined their environment in terms of both “nature” and “hazards.” they consistently identified foul odors, dirtiness, noise, trash, bugs, smoke, and other visible blights as indicators of household and neighborhood environmental hazards. they expressed fear and uncertainty about how their environment could affect their health and that of their children, as well as specific concerns about respiratory health, asthma, allergies, cancer, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. mothers often changed individual behaviors around diet and cleaning during pregnancy but were frustrated by power imbalances that left them unable to change their home or neighborhood environments, despite their desire to do so. discussion: our study is among the first to describe how urban latina mothers perceive and experience environmental health risks during pregnancy and early childhood. our research suggests additional attention is needed by public health professionals and researchers to address the environmental health risks that matter most to urban latina mothers. they also highlight the tension that many urban latina mothers feel between wanting to protect their families’ health and well-being and feeling powerless to change their environment. broad policy changes, rather than additional individual recommendations, are needed to address the concerns of this vulnerable population. © 2023, the author(s). environmental health; latina; mothers; perceptions; pregnancy child; child, preschool;

(pm2.5) is impacted by different sources each with different chemical composition. determining these sources is important for reducing personal exposure and its health risks especially during pregnancy. objective: identify main sources and their contributions to the personal pm2.5 exposure in 213 women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in los angeles, ca. methods: we measured 48-hr integrated personal pm2.5 exposure and analyzed filters for pm2.5 mass, elemental composition, and optical carbon fractions. we used the epa positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to resolve and quantify the major sources of personal pm2.5 exposure. we then investigated bivariate relationships between sources, time-activity patterns, and environmental exposures in activity spaces and residential neighborhoods to further understand sources. results: mean personal pm2.5 mass concentration was 22.3 (sd = 16.6) μg/m3. twenty-five species and pm2.5 mass were used in pmf with a final r2 of 0.48. we identified six sources (with major species in profiles and % contribution to pm2.5 mass) as follows: secondhand smoking (shs) (brown carbon, environmental tobacco smoke; 65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure; pm<sub>2.5</sub>; pregnancy; secondhand smoking source; source

background: prenatal air pollution exposure may increase risk for childhood obesity. however, few studies have evaluated in utero growth measures and infant weight trajectories. this study will evaluate the associations of prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants with weight trajectories from the 3rd trimester through age 2 years. methods: we studied 490 pregnant women who were recruited from the maternal and development risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, which comprises a low-income, primarily hispanic population in los angeles, california. nitrogen dioxide (no2), particulate matter < 10 µm (pm10), particulate matter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), and ozone (o3) concentrations during pregnancy were estimated from regulatory air monitoring stations. fetal weight was estimated from maternal ultrasound records. infant/child weight measurements were extracted from medical records or measured during follow-up visits. piecewise spline models were used to assess the effect of air pollutants on weight, overall growth, and growth during each period. results: the mean (sd) prenatal exposure concentrations for no2, pm2.5, pm10, and o3 were 16.4 (2.9) ppb, 12.0 (1.1) μg/m3, 28.5 (4.7) μg/m3, and 26.2 (2.9) ppb, respectively. comparing an increase in prenatal average air pollutants from the 10th to the 90th percentile, the growth rate from the 3rd trimester to age 3 months was significantly increased (1.55% [95%ci 1.20%, 1.99%] for pm2.5 and 1.64% [95%ci 1.27%, 2.13%] for no2), the growth rate from age 6 months to age 2 years was significantly decreased (0.90% [95%ci 0.82%, 1.00%] for no2), and the attained weight at age 2 years was significantly lower (− 7.50% [95% ci − 13.57%, − 1.02%] for pm10 and − 7.00% [95% ci − 11.86%, − 1.88%] for no2). conclusions: prenatal ambient air pollution was associated with variable changes in growth rate and attained weight from the 3rd trimester to age 2 years. these results suggest continued public health benefits of reducing ambient air pollution levels, particularly in marginalized populations. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer nature. in utero growth; infant weight trajectory;

cohort background: it is well documented that persons of color experience disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants, including air pollution, and have poorer pregnancy outcomes. this study assessed the critical windows of exposure to ambient air pollution on in utero fetal growth among structurally marginalized populations in urban los angeles. methods: participants (n = 281) from the larger ongoing madres pregnancy cohort study were included in this analysis. fetal growth outcomes were measured on average at 32 ± 2 weeks of gestation by a certified sonographer and included estimated fetal weight, abdominal circumference, head circumference, biparietal diameter and femur length. daily ambient air pollutant concentrations were estimated for four pollutants (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (pm2.5) and less than 10 µm (pm10) in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-h maximum ozone (o3)) at participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. weekly gestational averages were calculated from 12 weeks prior to conception to 32 weeks of gestation (44 total weeks), and their associations with growth outcomes were modeled using adjusted distributed lag models (dlms). results: participants were on average 29 years ± 6 old and predominately hispanic (82%). we identified a significant sensitive window of pm2.5 exposure (per iqr increase of 6 μg / m 3) between gestational weeks 4–16 for lower estimated fetal weight βaveraged4-16 = -8.7 g; 95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution;

depression at 12 months postpartum in the madres pregnancy cohort background: depression is the leading cause of mental health-related morbidity and affects twice as many women as men. hispanic/latina women in the us have unique risk factors for depression and they have lower utilization of mental health care services. identifying modifiable risk factors for maternal depression, such as ambient air pollution, is an urgent public health priority. we aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants was associated with maternal depression at 12 months after childbirth. methods: one hundred eighty predominantly low-income hispanic/latina women participating in the ongoing madres cohort study in los angeles, ca were followed from early pregnancy through 12 months postpartum through a series of phone questionnaires and in-person study visits. daily prenatal ambient pollutant estimates of nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and particulate matter (pm10 and pm2.5) were assigned to participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. exposures were averaged for each trimester and across pregnancy. the primary outcome measure was maternal depression at 12 months postpartum, as reported on the 20-item center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale. we classified each participant as depressed (n = 29) or not depressed (n = 151) based on the suggested cutoff of 16 or above (possible scores range from 0 to 60) and fitted logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. results: we found over a two-fold increased odds of depression at 12 months postpartum associated with second trimester no2 exposure (or = 2.63, 95% ci: 1.41–4.89) and pregnancy average no2 (or = 2.04, 95% ci: 1.13–3.69). higher second trimester pm2.5 exposure also was associated with increased depression at 12 months postpartum (or = 1.56, 95% ci: 1.01–2.42). the effect for second trimester pm10 was similar and was borderline significant (or = 1.58, 95% ci: 0.97–2.56). conclusions: in a low-income cohort consisting of primarily hispanic/latina women in urban los angeles, we found that prenatal ambient air pollution, especially mid-pregnancy no2 and pm2.5, increased the risk of depression at 12 months after childbirth. these results underscore the need to better understand the contribution of modifiable environmental risk factors during potentially critical exposure periods. © 2021, the author(s). air pollution; depression; environment; health disparities;

by environmental exposures during specific times during pregnancy. insights on potential sensitive windows of air pollution exposure in association with birth weight are needed. objective: to examine the association of sensitive windows of ambient air pollution exposure with birth weight and heterogeneity by individual- and neighborhood-level stressors. design, setting, and participants: data on a cohort of low-income hispanic women with singleton term pregnancy were collected from 2015 to 2021 in the ongoing maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors cohort in los angeles, california. exposures: daily ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (pm10) and aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-hour maximum ozone were assigned to residential locations. weekly averages from 12 weeks before conception to 36 gestational weeks were calculated. individual-level psychological stressor was measured by the perceived stress scale. neighborhood-level stressor was measured by the calenviroscreen 4.0. main outcomes and measures: sex-specific birth weight for gestational age z score (bwz). the associations between air pollutant and bwz were estimated using distributed lag models to identify sensitive windows of exposure, adjusting for maternal and meteorologic factors. we stratified the analyses by perceived stress scale and calenviroscreen 4.0. we converted the effect size estimation in bwz to grams to facilitate interpretation. results: the study included 628 pregnant women (mean [sd] age, 22.18 [5.92] years) and their newborns (mean [sd] bwz, -0.08 [1.03]). on average, an interquartile range (iqr) increase in pm2.5exposure during 4 to 22 gestational weeks was associated with a -9.5 g (95% ci, -10.4 to -8.6 g) change in birth weight. in stratified models, pm2.5from 4 to 24 gestational weeks was associated with a -34.0 g (95% ci, -35.7 to -32.4 g) change in birth weight and pm10from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -39.4 g (95% ci, -45.4 to -33.4) change in birth weight in the subgroup with high perceived stress scale and high calenviroscreen 4.0 scores. in this same group, no2from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -40.4 g (95% ci, -47.4 to -33.3 g) change in birth weight and, from 33 to 36 gestational weeks, a -117.6 g (95% ci, -125.3 to -83.7 g) change in birth weight. generally, there were no significant preconception windows for any air pollutants or ozone exposure with birth weight. conclusions and relevance: in this cohort study, early pregnancy to midpregnancy exposures to pm2.5, pm10, and no2were associated with lower birth weight, particularly for mothers experiencing higher perceived stress and living in a neighborhood with a high level of stressors from environmental pollution. © 2022 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; air pollutants; air pollution; birth weight; cohort studies;

however, data on biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among us pregnant women are scarce. we examined specific gravity adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (mufsg) in relation to sociodemographic variables and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california. methods: participants were from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort. there were 293 and 490 women with mufsg measured during first and third trimesters, respectively. an intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of mufsg between trimesters. kruskal–wallis and mann-whitney u tests examined associations of mufsg with sociodemographic variables. covariate adjusted linear regression examined associations of mufsg with blood metals and specific gravity adjusted urine metals among a subsample of participants within and between trimesters. a false discovery rate (fdr) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. results: median (iqr) mufsg was 0.65 (0.5) mg/l and 0.8 (0.59) mg/l, during trimesters one and three respectively. during both trimesters, mufsg was higher among older participants, those with higher income, and white, non-hispanic participants than hispanic participants. mufsg was also higher for white, non-hispanic participants than for black, non-hispanic participants in trimester three, and for those with graduate training in trimester one. mufsg was negatively associated with blood mercury in trimester one and positively associated with blood lead in trimester three. mufsg was positively associated with various urinary metals, including antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc in trimesters one and/or three. conclusions: mufsg levels observed were comparable to those found in pregnant women in mexico and canada that have been associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. lower urinary fluoride levels among hispanic and non-hispanic black participants in madres compared to non-hispanic white participants may reflect lower tap water consumption or lower fluoride exposure from other sources. additional research is needed to examine whether mufsg levels observed among pregnant women in the us are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer nature. biomarkers;

these 3 agents were correlated (r2 = 0.45–0.77)]. agents related to gasoline production or combustion were related to increased breast cancer risk [benzene (hr = 1.32, 95% ci 1.24, 1.41), ethylbenzene (hr = 1.20, 95% ci 1.13–1.28), toluene (hr = 1.29, 95% ci 1.20–1.38), naphthalene (hr = 1.11, 95% ci 1.02–2.22), acrolein (hr = 2.26, 95% ci 1.92, 2.65)]. higher hazard ratios were observed in african americans and whites compared to other racial and ethnic groups (p-heterogeneity <0.05 for traffic-related air toxics, acrolein, and vinyl acetate). conclusions: our findings suggest that specific toxic air pollutants may be associated with increase breast cancer risk. © 2024 the authors 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane;

95% ci: 1.08–2.37) and kriged no2 and breast cancer mortality (hr = 1.45; 95% ci 1.02–2.07). gaseous and pm pollutants were positively associated with breast cancer mortality across racial/ethnic group. conclusion: in this study, air pollutants have a harmful impact on breast cancer survival. additional studies should evaluate potential confounding by socioeconomic factors. these data support maintaining clean air laws to improve survival for women with breast cancer. © 2022 the author(s)  air pollutants;

65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

however, the impacts of these operations on neighborhood air quality are not well characterized. in this research, we leveraged ambient air monitoring adjacent to an oil and gas production site in los angeles, california during active and idle periods. this study analyzed continuous methane (ch4) and non-methane hydrocarbon (nmhc) measurements, together with triggered grab samples and 24 hour integrated canister samples collected by the south coast air quality management district. ambient air pollutant levels and trends were evaluated during active and idle well operations to assess changes in neighborhood air quality after the suspension of oil and gas production. we find that mean concentrations of methane, nmhc, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene, n-hexane, n-pentane, ethane, and propane decreased following the stop in production activities. using a source apportionment approach, we observed that the ""natural gas""drilling source contributed 23.7% to the total vocs measured during the active phase, and only 0.6% to the total measured vocs in the idle phase. near urban oil and gas production sites, residents may face poorer air quality due to the oil and gas activities which may pose adverse health and environmental risks among proximate communities.  © the royal society of chemistry.  air pollutants;

200 < λ < 1100) and chemical analyses were performed on collected particulate matter (pm), and relationships of brc light absorption (abs365) to source tracer chemical species were evaluated. mass absorption efficiency (mae) of both water and methanol extracted solutions exhibited an increasing trend from warm period to cold season, with an annual average value of 0.61 ± 0.22 m2.g− 1 and 1.38 ± 0.89 m2.g− 1, respectively. principal component analysis (pca) were coupled with multiple linear regression (mlr) to identify and quantify sources of brc light absorption in each of the seasons. our finding documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant source of brc light absorption during warm season, with relative contribution of 38% to total brc light absorption, followed by (secondary organic aerosol) soa (30%) and biomass burning (12%). in contrast, biomass burning was the major source of brc during the cold season (53%), while fossil fuel combustion and soa contributed to 18% and 12% of brc, respectively. significantly higher contribution of biomass burning to brc during the cold season suggested that residential heating activities (wood burning) play a major role in increased brc concentrations. previously collected aethalometer model data documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant contributing source to >90% of bc throughout the year. finally, the solar radiation absorption ratio of brc to elemental carbon (ec) in the ultraviolet range (300–400 nm) was maximum during the cold season with the annual corresponding values of 13–25% and 17–29% for water- and methanol-soluble brc, respectively; which provides further evidence of the important effect of brc light absorption on atmospheric radiative balance. © 2019 elsevier b.v. brc light absorption; pca-mlr; source apportionment; spectrophotometric analysis california;

n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.  aerosols;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤200 nm) and cch secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (bcas) in a murine model to produce white matter injury. based on other air pollution interac-tions, we predicted synergies of npm with bcas. methods: npm was collected using a particle sampler near a los angeles, california, freeway. mice were exposed to 10 wk of reaerosolized npm or filtered air (fa) for 150 h. cch was induced by bcas surgery. mice (c57bl/6j males) were randomized to four exposure paradigms: a) fa, b) npm, c) fa + bcas, and d) npm + bcas. behavioral outcomes, white matter injury, glial cell activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed. results: the joint npm + bcas group exhibited synergistic effects on white matter injury (2.3× the additive npm and fa + bcas scores) with greater loss of corpus callosum volume on t2 magnetic resonance imaging (mri) (30% smaller than fa group). histochemical analyses suggested potential microglial-specific inflammatory responses with synergistic effects on corpus callosum c5 immunofluorescent density and whole brain ni-trate concentrations (2.1× and 3.9× the additive npm and fa + bcas effects, respectively) in the joint exposure group. transcriptomic responses (rna-seq) showed greater impact of npm + bcas than individual additive effects, consistent with changes in proinflammatory pathways. although npm exposure alone did not alter working memory, the npm + bcas cohort demonstrated impaired working memory when compared to the fa + bcas group. discussion: our data suggest that npm and cch contribute to white matter injury in a synergistic manner in a mouse model. adverse neurological effects may be aggravated in a susceptible population exposed to air pollution. © 2021, public health services, us dept of health and human services. all rights reserved.  air pollution;

n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.  aerosols;

13–23%) and magnetite (fe3o4; 10–24%) identified as major crystalline oxide components. an fe-bearing phyllosilicate fraction (16–23%) was fit best with a reference spectrum of a natural illite/smectite mineral, and metallic fe(0) was a relatively small (2–6%) but easily identified component. sizes, morphologies, oxidation state, and trace element compositions of fe-bearing pm from electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy (eels), and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (stxm) revealed variable and heterogeneous mixtures of fe species and phases, often associated with carbonaceous material with evidence of surface oxidation. ferrihydrite (or related fe(iii) hydroxide phases) was ubiquitous in pm samples. it forms as an oxidation or surface alteration product of crystalline fe phases, and also occurs as coatings or nanoparticles dispersed with other phases as a result of environmental dissolution and re-precipitation reactions. the prevalence of ferrihydrite (and adsorbed fe(iii)) has likely been underestimated in studies of ambient pm because it is non-crystalline, non-magnetic, more soluble than crystalline phases, and found in complex mixtures. review of potential sources of different particle types suggests that the majority of fe-bearing pm from these urban sites originates from anthropogenic activities, primarily abrasion products from vehicle braking systems and engine emissions from combustion and/or wear. these variable mixtures have a high probability for electron transfer reactions between fe, redox-active metals such as copper, and reactive carbon species such as quinones. our findings suggest the need to assess biological responses of specific fe-bearing phases both individually and in combination to unravel mechanisms of adverse health effects of particulate fe. © 2020 6): pm<sub>2.5</sub>;

200 < λ < 1100) and chemical analyses were performed on collected particulate matter (pm), and relationships of brc light absorption (abs365) to source tracer chemical species were evaluated. mass absorption efficiency (mae) of both water and methanol extracted solutions exhibited an increasing trend from warm period to cold season, with an annual average value of 0.61 ± 0.22 m2.g− 1 and 1.38 ± 0.89 m2.g− 1, respectively. principal component analysis (pca) were coupled with multiple linear regression (mlr) to identify and quantify sources of brc light absorption in each of the seasons. our finding documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant source of brc light absorption during warm season, with relative contribution of 38% to total brc light absorption, followed by (secondary organic aerosol) soa (30%) and biomass burning (12%). in contrast, biomass burning was the major source of brc during the cold season (53%), while fossil fuel combustion and soa contributed to 18% and 12% of brc, respectively. significantly higher contribution of biomass burning to brc during the cold season suggested that residential heating activities (wood burning) play a major role in increased brc concentrations. previously collected aethalometer model data documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant contributing source to >90% of bc throughout the year. finally, the solar radiation absorption ratio of brc to elemental carbon (ec) in the ultraviolet range (300–400 nm) was maximum during the cold season with the annual corresponding values of 13–25% and 17–29% for water- and methanol-soluble brc, respectively; which provides further evidence of the important effect of brc light absorption on atmospheric radiative balance. © 2019 elsevier b.v. brc light absorption; pca-mlr; source apportionment; spectrophotometric analysis california;

fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤200 nm) and cch secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (bcas) in a murine model to produce white matter injury. based on other air pollution interac-tions, we predicted synergies of npm with bcas. methods: npm was collected using a particle sampler near a los angeles, california, freeway. mice were exposed to 10 wk of reaerosolized npm or filtered air (fa) for 150 h. cch was induced by bcas surgery. mice (c57bl/6j males) were randomized to four exposure paradigms: a) fa, b) npm, c) fa + bcas, and d) npm + bcas. behavioral outcomes, white matter injury, glial cell activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed. results: the joint npm + bcas group exhibited synergistic effects on white matter injury (2.3× the additive npm and fa + bcas scores) with greater loss of corpus callosum volume on t2 magnetic resonance imaging (mri) (30% smaller than fa group). histochemical analyses suggested potential microglial-specific inflammatory responses with synergistic effects on corpus callosum c5 immunofluorescent density and whole brain ni-trate concentrations (2.1× and 3.9× the additive npm and fa + bcas effects, respectively) in the joint exposure group. transcriptomic responses (rna-seq) showed greater impact of npm + bcas than individual additive effects, consistent with changes in proinflammatory pathways. although npm exposure alone did not alter working memory, the npm + bcas cohort demonstrated impaired working memory when compared to the fa + bcas group. discussion: our data suggest that npm and cch contribute to white matter injury in a synergistic manner in a mouse model. adverse neurological effects may be aggravated in a susceptible population exposed to air pollution. © 2021, public health services, us dept of health and human services. all rights reserved.  air pollution;

n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.  aerosols;

65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

Serum cortisol;Air Pollution; DLM; Fetal Growth; Health Disparities; Particulate Matter; Pregnancy","ambient air pollutants are associated with morning serum cortisol in overweight and obese latino youth in los angeles background: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa)-axis dysfunction has been associated with a variety of mental health and cardio-metabolic disorders. while causal models of hpa-axis dysregulation have been largely focused on either pre-existing health conditions or psychosocial stress factors, recent evidence suggests a possible role for central nervous system activation via air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3) and particulate matter (pm). therefore, in an observational study of latino youth, we investigated if monthly ambient no2, o3, and pm with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 (pm2.5) exposure were associated with morning serum cortisol levels. methods: in this cross-sectional study, morning serum cortisol level was assessed after a supervised overnight fast in 203 overweight and obese latino children and adolescents (female/male: 88/115; mean age: 11.1 ± 1.7 years; pre-pubertal/pubertal/post-pubertal: 85/101/17; bmi z-score: 2.1 ± 0.4). cumulative concentrations of no2, o3 and pm2.5 were spatially interpolated at the residential addresses based on measurements from community monitors up to 12 months prior to testing. single and multi-pollutant linear effects models were used to test the cumulative monthly lag effects of no2, o3, and pm2.5 on morning serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, sex, seasonality, social position, pubertal status, and body fat percent by dexa. results: single and multi-pollutant models showed that higher o3 exposure (derived from maximum 8-h exposure windows) in the prior 1–7 months was associated with higher serum morning cortisol (p < 0.05) and longer term pm2.5 exposure (4–10 months) was associated with lower serum morning cortisol levels (p < 0.05). stratification by pubertal status showed associations in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal and post-pubertal children. single, but not multi-pollutant, models showed that higher no2 over the 4–10 month exposure period associated with lower morning serum cortisol (p < 0.05). conclusions: chronic ambient no2, o3 and pm2.5 differentially associate with hpa-axis dysfunction, a mechanism that may serve as an explanatory pathway in the relationship between ambient air pollution and metabolic health of youth living in polluted urban environments. further research that uncovers how ambient air pollutants may differentially contribute to hpa-axis dysfunction are warranted. © 2021, the author(s). ambient air pollution;

time factor;identifying pre-conception and pre-natal periods in which ambient air pollution exposure affects fetal growth in the predominately hispanic madres cohort background: it is well documented that persons of color experience disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants, including air pollution, and have poorer pregnancy outcomes. this study assessed the critical windows of exposure to ambient air pollution on in utero fetal growth among structurally marginalized populations in urban los angeles. methods: participants (n = 281) from the larger ongoing madres pregnancy cohort study were included in this analysis. fetal growth outcomes were measured on average at 32 ± 2 weeks of gestation by a certified sonographer and included estimated fetal weight, abdominal circumference, head circumference, biparietal diameter and femur length. daily ambient air pollutant concentrations were estimated for four pollutants (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (pm2.5) and less than 10 µm (pm10) in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-h maximum ozone (o3)) at participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. weekly gestational averages were calculated from 12 weeks prior to conception to 32 weeks of gestation (44 total weeks), and their associations with growth outcomes were modeled using adjusted distributed lag models (dlms). results: participants were on average 29 years ± 6 old and predominately hispanic (82%). we identified a significant sensitive window of pm2.5 exposure (per iqr increase of 6 μg / m 3) between gestational weeks 4–16 for lower estimated fetal weight βaveraged4-16 = -8.7 g; 95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution;

n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.  aerosols;

(2) the free tropospheric background atmosphere is simultaneously measured; and (3) the measurements are highly sensitive to anthropogenic emissions due to the long light path along the planetary boundary layer (pbl). the co slant column density and xco are retrieved from reflected sunlight measurements in the 2.3 μm co band and the 1.27 μm oxygen (o2) band. data filtering and corrections for aerosol scattering and geometric effects are then implemented to derive the xco enhancement, which is the xco excess in the pbl compared to the background value. in the la megacity, the xco enhancement shows a distinctive diurnal cycle primarily driven by changes in anthropogenic emissions and sea-breeze circulation. such diurnal patterns can be reproduced by the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry (wrf-chem). the enhancement also shows a significant weekly cycle resulting from the weekly pattern in anthropogenic co emissions. on average, the xco enhancements on sunday and saturday are 16.1% and 4.4%, respectively, lower than weekday values. the weekly xco enhancement patterns also show high correlation with traffic counts. a seasonal pattern of xco enhancement with high (low) spatial contrast in summer (winter), resulting from changing sea-breeze circulation, can be observed. these diurnal, weekly, and seasonal patterns of xco enhancement serve as tracers of the atmospheric pulse of the la megacity. the clars observatory can serve as a testbed for future geostationary missions to track anthropogenic emissions in cities. © 2020 elsevier inc. atmospheric pulse;

n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.  aerosols;

fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤200 nm) and cch secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (bcas) in a murine model to produce white matter injury. based on other air pollution interac-tions, we predicted synergies of npm with bcas. methods: npm was collected using a particle sampler near a los angeles, california, freeway. mice were exposed to 10 wk of reaerosolized npm or filtered air (fa) for 150 h. cch was induced by bcas surgery. mice (c57bl/6j males) were randomized to four exposure paradigms: a) fa, b) npm, c) fa + bcas, and d) npm + bcas. behavioral outcomes, white matter injury, glial cell activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed. results: the joint npm + bcas group exhibited synergistic effects on white matter injury (2.3× the additive npm and fa + bcas scores) with greater loss of corpus callosum volume on t2 magnetic resonance imaging (mri) (30% smaller than fa group). histochemical analyses suggested potential microglial-specific inflammatory responses with synergistic effects on corpus callosum c5 immunofluorescent density and whole brain ni-trate concentrations (2.1× and 3.9× the additive npm and fa + bcas effects, respectively) in the joint exposure group. transcriptomic responses (rna-seq) showed greater impact of npm + bcas than individual additive effects, consistent with changes in proinflammatory pathways. although npm exposure alone did not alter working memory, the npm + bcas cohort demonstrated impaired working memory when compared to the fa + bcas group. discussion: our data suggest that npm and cch contribute to white matter injury in a synergistic manner in a mouse model. adverse neurological effects may be aggravated in a susceptible population exposed to air pollution. © 2021, public health services, us dept of health and human services. all rights reserved.  air pollution;

microenvironment; peak exposures; personal exposure; primary combustion; time-activity ;sources of personal pm2.5 exposure during pregnancy in the madres cohort background: personal exposure to fine particulate matter (pm2.5) is impacted by different sources each with different chemical composition. determining these sources is important for reducing personal exposure and its health risks especially during pregnancy. objective: identify main sources and their contributions to the personal pm2.5 exposure in 213 women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in los angeles, ca. methods: we measured 48-hr integrated personal pm2.5 exposure and analyzed filters for pm2.5 mass, elemental composition, and optical carbon fractions. we used the epa positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to resolve and quantify the major sources of personal pm2.5 exposure. we then investigated bivariate relationships between sources, time-activity patterns, and environmental exposures in activity spaces and residential neighborhoods to further understand sources. results: mean personal pm2.5 mass concentration was 22.3 (sd = 16.6) μg/m3. twenty-five species and pm2.5 mass were used in pmf with a final r2 of 0.48. we identified six sources (with major species in profiles and % contribution to pm2.5 mass) as follows: secondhand smoking (shs) (brown carbon, environmental tobacco smoke; 65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

200 < λ < 1100) and chemical analyses were performed on collected particulate matter (pm), and relationships of brc light absorption (abs365) to source tracer chemical species were evaluated. mass absorption efficiency (mae) of both water and methanol extracted solutions exhibited an increasing trend from warm period to cold season, with an annual average value of 0.61 ± 0.22 m2.g− 1 and 1.38 ± 0.89 m2.g− 1, respectively. principal component analysis (pca) were coupled with multiple linear regression (mlr) to identify and quantify sources of brc light absorption in each of the seasons. our finding documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant source of brc light absorption during warm season, with relative contribution of 38% to total brc light absorption, followed by (secondary organic aerosol) soa (30%) and biomass burning (12%). in contrast, biomass burning was the major source of brc during the cold season (53%), while fossil fuel combustion and soa contributed to 18% and 12% of brc, respectively. significantly higher contribution of biomass burning to brc during the cold season suggested that residential heating activities (wood burning) play a major role in increased brc concentrations. previously collected aethalometer model data documented fossil fuel combustion as the dominant contributing source to >90% of bc throughout the year. finally, the solar radiation absorption ratio of brc to elemental carbon (ec) in the ultraviolet range (300–400 nm) was maximum during the cold season with the annual corresponding values of 13–25% and 17–29% for water- and methanol-soluble brc, respectively; which provides further evidence of the important effect of brc light absorption on atmospheric radiative balance. © 2019 elsevier b.v. brc light absorption; pca-mlr; source apportionment; spectrophotometric analysis california;

the poa/co ratios decreased from about 6.5 to 5 μg/m3/ppm from 2015 to 2019, which is consistent with the trend of tailpipe emission contributions to total oc concentrations in our monitoring site. ec was also strongly correlated with no2 (r2 > 0.73) and co (r2 > 0.70) because they are emitted from the same combustion sources (e.g., vehicular emissions in central los angeles). our results show persistent and significant correlations between the concentrations of criteria gaseous pollutants and carbonaceous pm2.5 species (i.e., poa, soa, and ec) in different years, offering a straightforward approach to estimate the 24-h average concentration of these pm species in central los angeles. © 2021 elsevier ltd carbonaceous pm species;

higher prenatal fluoride exposure with poorer neurobehavioral development, but whether this association holds for us-based populations is unknown. objective: to examine associations of third trimester maternal urinary fluoride (muf) with child neurobehavior at age 3 years in the us. design, setting, and participants: this prospective cohort study utilized urine samples archived from 2017 to 2020 and neurobehavioral data assessed from 2020 to 2023 from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort, which consisted of predominately hispanic women residing in los angeles, california. cohort eligibility criteria at recruitment included being 18 years of age or older, less than 30 weeks' gestation, and a fluent english or spanish speaker. exclusion criteria included having a disability preventing participation or provision of informed consent, being hiv positive or incarcerated, and having a multiple gestation pregnancy. there were 263 mother-child pairs who completed the 3-year study visit. in this analysis, women who reported prenatal smoking were excluded. data analysis was conducted from october 2022 to march 2024. exposure: specific gravity-adjusted muf (mufsg), a biomarker of prenatal fluoride exposure. main outcomes and measures: neurobehavior was quantified using the preschool child behavior checklist (cbcl), which included composite scores for total problems, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. cbcl composite t scores range from 28 to 100. t scores from 60 to 63 are in the borderline clinical range, whereas scores above 63 are in the clinical range. linear and logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were conducted. results: a total of 229 mother-child pairs (mean [sd] maternal age, 29.45 [5.67] years; 116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; child behavior; child development;

biomarkers and patterns of fluoride exposure among us pregnant women are scarce. we examined specific gravity adjusted maternal urinary fluoride (mufsg) in relation to sociodemographic variables and metal co-exposures among pregnant women in los angeles, california. methods: participants were from the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort. there were 293 and 490 women with mufsg measured during first and third trimesters, respectively. an intra-class correlation coefficient examined consistency of mufsg between trimesters. kruskal–wallis and mann-whitney u tests examined associations of mufsg with sociodemographic variables. covariate adjusted linear regression examined associations of mufsg with blood metals and specific gravity adjusted urine metals among a subsample of participants within and between trimesters. a false discovery rate (fdr) correction accounted for multiple comparisons. results: median (iqr) mufsg was 0.65 (0.5) mg/l and 0.8 (0.59) mg/l, during trimesters one and three respectively. during both trimesters, mufsg was higher among older participants, those with higher income, and white, non-hispanic participants than hispanic participants. mufsg was also higher for white, non-hispanic participants than for black, non-hispanic participants in trimester three, and for those with graduate training in trimester one. mufsg was negatively associated with blood mercury in trimester one and positively associated with blood lead in trimester three. mufsg was positively associated with various urinary metals, including antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc in trimesters one and/or three. conclusions: mufsg levels observed were comparable to those found in pregnant women in mexico and canada that have been associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. lower urinary fluoride levels among hispanic and non-hispanic black participants in madres compared to non-hispanic white participants may reflect lower tap water consumption or lower fluoride exposure from other sources. additional research is needed to examine whether mufsg levels observed among pregnant women in the us are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part of springer nature. biomarkers; fluoride; hispanic women; los angeles; metals; pregnancy

trimester of pregnancy to 2 years of age: a cohort study background: prenatal air pollution exposure may increase risk for childhood obesity. however, few studies have evaluated in utero growth measures and infant weight trajectories. this study will evaluate the associations of prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants with weight trajectories from the 3rd trimester through age 2 years. methods: we studied 490 pregnant women who were recruited from the maternal and development risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, which comprises a low-income, primarily hispanic population in los angeles, california. nitrogen dioxide (no2), particulate matter < 10 µm (pm10), particulate matter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), and ozone (o3) concentrations during pregnancy were estimated from regulatory air monitoring stations. fetal weight was estimated from maternal ultrasound records. infant/child weight measurements were extracted from medical records or measured during follow-up visits. piecewise spline models were used to assess the effect of air pollutants on weight, overall growth, and growth during each period. results: the mean (sd) prenatal exposure concentrations for no2, pm2.5, pm10, and o3 were 16.4 (2.9) ppb, 12.0 (1.1) μg/m3, 28.5 (4.7) μg/m3, and 26.2 (2.9) ppb, respectively. comparing an increase in prenatal average air pollutants from the 10th to the 90th percentile, the growth rate from the 3rd trimester to age 3 months was significantly increased (1.55% [95%ci 1.20%, 1.99%] for pm2.5 and 1.64% [95%ci 1.27%, 2.13%] for no2), the growth rate from age 6 months to age 2 years was significantly decreased (0.90% [95%ci 0.82%, 1.00%] for no2), and the attained weight at age 2 years was significantly lower (− 7.50% [95% ci − 13.57%, − 1.02%] for pm10 and − 7.00% [95% ci − 11.86%, − 1.88%] for no2). conclusions: prenatal ambient air pollution was associated with variable changes in growth rate and attained weight from the 3rd trimester to age 2 years. these results suggest continued public health benefits of reducing ambient air pollution levels, particularly in marginalized populations. © 2023, biomed central ltd., part

cohort in los angeles background: arsenic (as) is a contaminant of top public health concern, due to its range of detrimental health effects. arsenic exposure has not been well-characterized among the us hispanic populations and has been particularly understudied in this population during pregnancy. methods: as part of the madres ongoing pregnancy cohort of predominantly lower-income, hispanic women in los angeles, ca, we examined levels of maternal first trimester urinary as, including total as and as metabolites (inorganic (ias), monomethylated (mma) and dimethylated as (dma)), in relation to participant demographics, lifestyle characteristics, and rice/seafood consumption, to identify factors that may influence as exposure and its metabolites during pregnancy (n = 241). results: total as concentrations ranged from low to high (0.8–506.2 μg/l, mean: 9.0 μg/l, sd: 32.9) in our study population. foreign-born hispanic women had 8.6% higher %dma (95% ci: 3.3%, 13.9%) and −7.7% lower %ias (95% ci: −12.6%, −2.9%) than non-hispanic women. a similar trend was observed for us-born hispanic women. in addition, maternal age was associated with 0.4% higher %ias (95% ci: 0.1%, 0.6%) and 0.4% lower %dma (95% ci: −0.7%, −0.1%) per year, which may indicate poor as methylation capacity. conclusion: individual factors may predict as exposure and metabolism in pregnancy, and in turn, greater risk of adverse health effects. © 2020, the author(s), under exclusive licence to springer nature america, inc. arsenic; cohort; environment; health disparities; hispanic; pregnancy

pregnancy;ev-mirna associated with environmental air pollution exposures in the madres cohort air pollution is a hazardous contaminant, exposure to which has substantial consequences for health during critical periods, such as pregnancy. microrna (mirna) is an epigenetic mechanism that modulates transcriptome responses to the environment and has been found to change in reaction to air pollution exposure. the data are limited regarding extracellular-vesicle (ev) mirna variation associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy and in susceptible populations who may be disproportionately exposed. this study aimed to identify ev-mirna expression associated with ambient, residential exposure to pm2.5, pm10, no2, o3 and with traffic-related nox in 461 participants of the madres cohort, a low income, predominantly hispanic pregnancy cohort based in los angeles, ca. this study used residence-based modeled air pollution data as well as nanostring panels for evmirna extracted with qiagen exorneasy kits to evaluate 483 mirna in plasma in early and late pregnancy. average air pollution exposures were considered separately for 1-day, 1-week, and 8-week windows before blood collection in both early and late pregnancy. this study identified 63 and 66 evmirna significantly associated with pm2.5 and pm10, respectively, and 2 mirna associated with traffic-related nox (false discovery rate-adjusted p-value < .05). of 103 unique ev-mirna associated with pm, 92% were associated with lung conditions according to hmdd (human mirna disease database) evidence. in particular, ev-mirna previously identified with air pollution exposure also associated with pm2.5 and pm10 in this study were: mir-126, mir-16-5p, mir-187-3p, mir200b-3p, mir486-3p, and mir-582-3p. there were no significant differences in average exposures in early vs late pregnancy. significant ev-mirnas were only identified in late pregnancy with an 8-week exposure window, suggesting a vulnerable timeframe of exposure, rather than an acute response. these results describe a wide array of ev-mirna for which expression is affected by pm exposure and may be in part mediating the biological response to ambient air pollution, with potential for health implications in pregnant women and their children. © the author(s) 2024. published by oxford university press. air pollution; microrna; particulate

age: a pooled analysis of three cohorts participating in the echo program background: a growing number of studies have identified both toxic and essential metals which influence fetal growth. however, most studies have conducted single-cohort analyses, which are often limited by narrow exposure ranges, and evaluated metals individually. the objective of the current study was to conduct an environmental mixture analysis of metal impacts on fetal growth, pooling data from three geographically and demographically diverse cohorts in the united states participating in the environmental influences on child health outcomes program. methods: the pooled sample (n = 1,002) included participants from the madres, nhbcs, and protect cohorts. associations between seven metals (antimony, cadmium, cobalt, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, tin) measured in maternal urine samples collected during pregnancy (median: 16.0 weeks gestation) and birth weight for gestational age z-scores (bw for ga) were investigated using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). models were also stratified by cohort and infant sex to investigate possible heterogeneity. chromium and uranium concentrations fell below the limits of detection for most participants and were evaluated separately as binary variables using pooled linear regression models. results: in the pooled bkmr analysis, antimony, mercury, and tin were inversely and linearly associated with bw for ga, while a positive linear association was identified for nickel. the inverse association between antimony and bw for ga was observed in both males and females and for all three cohorts but was strongest for madres, a predominantly low-income hispanic cohort in los angeles. a reverse j-shaped association was identified between cobalt and bw for ga, which was driven by female infants. pooled associations were null for cadmium, chromium, molybdenum, and uranium, and bkmr did not identify potential interactions between metal pairs. conclusions: findings suggest that antimony, an understudied metalloid, may adversely impact fetal growth. cohort- and/or sex-dependent associations were identified for many of the metals, which merit additional investigation. © 2022 bkmr; fetal growth; metalloids; metals; mixtures; pooled analysis bayes theorem; birth weight; child; female; gestational age; humans; infant;

2.5 μm (pm2.5) is associated with low birth weight and health risks later in life. pregnant women are mobile and locations they spend time in contribute to their personal pm2.5 exposures. therefore, it is important to understand how mobility and exposures encountered within activity spaces contribute to personal pm2.5 exposures during pregnancy. methods: we collected 48-h integrated personal pm2.5 samples and continuous geolocation (gps) data for 213 predominantly hispanic/latina pregnant women in their 3rd trimester in los angeles, ca. we also collected questionnaires and modeled outdoor air pollution and meteorology in their residential neighborhood. we calculated three gps-derived activity space measures of exposure to road networks, greenness (ndvi), parks, traffic volume, walkability, and outdoor pm2.5 and temperature. we used bivariate analyses to screen variables (gps-extracted exposures in activity spaces, individual characteristics, and residential neighborhood exposures) based on their relationship with personal, 48-h integrated pm2.5 concentrations. we then built a generalized linear model to explain the variability in personal pm2.5 exposure and identify key contributing factors. results: indoor pm2.5 sources, parity, and home ventilation were significantly associated with personal exposure. activity-space based exposure to roads was associated with significantly higher personal pm2.5 exposure, while greenness was associated with lower personal pm2.5 exposure (β = −3.09 μg/m3 per sd increase in ndvi, p-value = 0.018). the contribution of outdoor pm2.5 to personal exposure was positive but relatively lower (β = 2.05 μg/m3 per sd increase, p-value = 0.016) than exposures in activity spaces and the indoor environment. the final model explained 34% of the variability in personal pm2.5 concentrations. conclusions: our findings highlight the importance of activity spaces and the indoor environment on personal pm2.5 exposures of pregnant women living in los angeles, ca. this work also showcases the multiple, complex factors that contribute to total personal pm2.5 exposure. © 2022 elsevier inc. activity spaces; air pollution; gps; personal

exposure to fine particulate matter (pm2.5) is impacted by different sources each with different chemical composition. determining these sources is important for reducing personal exposure and its health risks especially during pregnancy. objective: identify main sources and their contributions to the personal pm2.5 exposure in 213 women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in los angeles, ca. methods: we measured 48-hr integrated personal pm2.5 exposure and analyzed filters for pm2.5 mass, elemental composition, and optical carbon fractions. we used the epa positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to resolve and quantify the major sources of personal pm2.5 exposure. we then investigated bivariate relationships between sources, time-activity patterns, and environmental exposures in activity spaces and residential neighborhoods to further understand sources. results: mean personal pm2.5 mass concentration was 22.3 (sd = 16.6) μg/m3. twenty-five species and pm2.5 mass were used in pmf with a final r2 of 0.48. we identified six sources (with major species in profiles and % contribution to pm2.5 mass) as follows: secondhand smoking (shs) (brown carbon, environmental tobacco smoke; 65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure; pm<sub>2.5</sub>; pregnancy; secondhand

pregnancy cohort study background: air pollution has been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). we aim to investigate susceptible windows of air pollution exposure and factors determining population vulnerability. methods: we ascertained gdm status in the prospective maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) pregnancy cohort from los angeles, california, usa. we calculated the relative risk of gdm by exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm10; pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of

environmental exposures during pregnancy and early childhood can have acute and chronic adverse health impacts. as minoritized populations are more likely to reside in areas with greater pollution, it is important to understand their views and lived experiences to inform action. the purpose of this community-driven qualitative research study was to understand how urban latina mothers in los angeles county, california perceived environmental health and risks. methods: we conducted semi-structured individual interviews with latina pregnant women and mothers of young children, recruited through existing collaborations with community organizations. interviews conducted in either english or spanish and were coded inductively according to a modified grounded theory approach. results: thirty-six latina mothers completed interviews between august–october 2016. participants lived primarily in low-income communities of south-central los angeles and east los angeles. we identified three major themes based on the participants’ responses during interviews: defining the environment, environment & health risks, and social & political responsibility. women defined their environment in terms of both “nature” and “hazards.” they consistently identified foul odors, dirtiness, noise, trash, bugs, smoke, and other visible blights as indicators of household and neighborhood environmental hazards. they expressed fear and uncertainty about how their environment could affect their health and that of their children, as well as specific concerns about respiratory health, asthma, allergies, cancer, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. mothers often changed individual behaviors around diet and cleaning during pregnancy but were frustrated by power imbalances that left them unable to change their home or neighborhood environments, despite their desire to do so. discussion: our study is among the first to describe how urban latina mothers perceive and experience environmental health risks during pregnancy and early childhood. our research suggests additional attention is needed by public health professionals and researchers to address the environmental health risks that matter most to urban latina mothers. they also highlight the tension that many urban latina mothers feel between wanting to protect their families’ health and well-being and feeling powerless to change their environment. broad policy changes, rather than additional individual recommendations, are needed to address the concerns of this vulnerable population. © 2023, the author(s). environmental health; latina; mothers;

exposure affects fetal growth in the predominately hispanic madres cohort background: it is well documented that persons of color experience disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants, including air pollution, and have poorer pregnancy outcomes. this study assessed the critical windows of exposure to ambient air pollution on in utero fetal growth among structurally marginalized populations in urban los angeles. methods: participants (n = 281) from the larger ongoing madres pregnancy cohort study were included in this analysis. fetal growth outcomes were measured on average at 32 ± 2 weeks of gestation by a certified sonographer and included estimated fetal weight, abdominal circumference, head circumference, biparietal diameter and femur length. daily ambient air pollutant concentrations were estimated for four pollutants (particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (pm2.5) and less than 10 µm (pm10) in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-h maximum ozone (o3)) at participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. weekly gestational averages were calculated from 12 weeks prior to conception to 32 weeks of gestation (44 total weeks), and their associations with growth outcomes were modeled using adjusted distributed lag models (dlms). results: participants were on average 29 years ± 6 old and predominately hispanic (82%). we identified a significant sensitive window of pm2.5 exposure (per iqr increase of 6 μg / m 3) between gestational weeks 4–16 for lower estimated fetal weight βaveraged4-16 = -8.7 g; 95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution; dlm; fetal growth; health disparities; particulate matter; pregnancy air pollution; cohort studies; environmental exposure;

important environmental risk for maternal and children's health, with peak exposures especially those derived from primary combustion hypothesized to pose greater risk. identifying pm2.5 peaks and their contributions to personal exposure remains challenging. this study measured personal pm2.5 exposure, characterized primary combustion peaks, and investigated their determinants during and after pregnancy and among hispanic women in los angeles, ca. methods: continuous personal pm2.5 exposure, global positioning system geolocation, and ecological momentary assessment surveys were collected from 63 women for 4 consecutive days in their 1st trimester, 3rd trimester and 4–6 months postpartum. based on the shape of pm2.5 time-series, primary combustion peaks were identified, characterized (number, duration, area under the curve [auc]), and linked with locations they occurred in. zero-inflated generalized mixed-effect models were used to examine the spatial and temporal determinants of pm2.5 peak exposures. results: a total of 490 pm2.5 peaks were identified from 618 person-days of monitoring. spending an additional minute at parks and open spaces was related to smaller (auc decreased 3.1 %, 95 % ci: 1.5 %–4.6 %) and shorter (duration decreased 1.7 %, 0.5 %–2.9 %) pm2.5 peak exposure. an additional minute in vehicular trips also related to smaller and shorter peak exposure (auc and duration decreased 2.5 %, 1.2 %–3.7 % and 1.8 %, 1.0 %–2.6 %, respectively). however, an additional minute at industrial locations was associated with greater number (3.6 %, 2.0 %–5.2 %), auc (1.6 %, 0.1 %–3.2 %) and duration (1.0 %, 0.0 %–2.1 %) of personal pm2.5 peak exposure. conclusions: this study demonstrates the potential to statistically identify exposure to primary combustion pm2.5 peaks and understand their determinants from personal monitoring data. results suggest that visits to parks and open spaces may minimize pm2.5 peak exposures, while visiting industrial locations may increase them in and around pregnancy. © 2024 fine particulate matter; microenvironment; peak exposures; personal exposure; primary combustion; time-activity ;increased risk of gestational hypertension by periconceptional exposure to ambient air pollution and effect modification by prenatal depression background: air pollution has been associated with gestational hypertension (gh) and preeclampsia, but susceptible windows of exposure and potential vulnerability by comorbidities, such as prenatal depression, remain unclear. methods: we ascertained gh and preeclampsia cases in a prospective pregnancy cohort in los angeles, ca daily levels of ambient particulate matters (with a diameter of ≤10 μm [pm10] or ≤2.5 μm [pm2.5]), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone were averaged for each week from 12 weeks preconception to 20 gestational weeks. we used distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows, adjusting for potential confounders. analyses were additionally stratified by probable prenatal depression to explore population vulnerability. results: among 619 participants, 60 developed preeclampsia and 42 developed gh. we identified a susceptible window for exposure to pm2.5from 1 week preconception to 11 weeks postconception: higher exposure (5 μg/m3) within this window was associated with an average of 8% (95% ci, 1%-15%) higher risk of gh. among participants with probable prenatal depression (n=179; 32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution; depression;

interrupted by environmental exposures during specific times during pregnancy. insights on potential sensitive windows of air pollution exposure in association with birth weight are needed. objective: to examine the association of sensitive windows of ambient air pollution exposure with birth weight and heterogeneity by individual- and neighborhood-level stressors. design, setting, and participants: data on a cohort of low-income hispanic women with singleton term pregnancy were collected from 2015 to 2021 in the ongoing maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors cohort in los angeles, california. exposures: daily ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (pm10) and aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and 8-hour maximum ozone were assigned to residential locations. weekly averages from 12 weeks before conception to 36 gestational weeks were calculated. individual-level psychological stressor was measured by the perceived stress scale. neighborhood-level stressor was measured by the calenviroscreen 4.0. main outcomes and measures: sex-specific birth weight for gestational age z score (bwz). the associations between air pollutant and bwz were estimated using distributed lag models to identify sensitive windows of exposure, adjusting for maternal and meteorologic factors. we stratified the analyses by perceived stress scale and calenviroscreen 4.0. we converted the effect size estimation in bwz to grams to facilitate interpretation. results: the study included 628 pregnant women (mean [sd] age, 22.18 [5.92] years) and their newborns (mean [sd] bwz, -0.08 [1.03]). on average, an interquartile range (iqr) increase in pm2.5exposure during 4 to 22 gestational weeks was associated with a -9.5 g (95% ci, -10.4 to -8.6 g) change in birth weight. in stratified models, pm2.5from 4 to 24 gestational weeks was associated with a -34.0 g (95% ci, -35.7 to -32.4 g) change in birth weight and pm10from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -39.4 g (95% ci, -45.4 to -33.4) change in birth weight in the subgroup with high perceived stress scale and high calenviroscreen 4.0 scores. in this same group, no2from 9 to 14 gestational weeks was associated with a -40.4 g (95% ci, -47.4 to -33.3 g) change in birth weight and, from 33 to 36 gestational weeks, a -117.6 g (95% ci, -125.3 to -83.7 g) change in birth weight. generally, there were no significant preconception windows for any air pollutants or ozone exposure with birth weight. conclusions and relevance: in this cohort study, early pregnancy to midpregnancy exposures to pm2.5, pm10, and no2were associated with lower birth weight, particularly for mothers experiencing higher perceived stress and living in a neighborhood with a high level of stressors from environmental pollution. © 2022 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult; air pollutants; air pollution; birth weight;

background: depression substantially contributes to pregnancy-related morbidity, and pregnancy is increasingly recognized as a vulnerable window for exposure effects on maternal mental health. exposures to organophosphate esters (opes) are ubiquitous and may have neurotoxic effects; however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression; mixtures analysis; organophosphate esters adult; depression; environmental pollutants; esters; female; flame retardants; humans; los angeles;

pregnancy cohort background: depression is the leading cause of mental health-related morbidity and affects twice as many women as men. hispanic/latina women in the us have unique risk factors for depression and they have lower utilization of mental health care services. identifying modifiable risk factors for maternal depression, such as ambient air pollution, is an urgent public health priority. we aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants was associated with maternal depression at 12 months after childbirth. methods: one hundred eighty predominantly low-income hispanic/latina women participating in the ongoing madres cohort study in los angeles, ca were followed from early pregnancy through 12 months postpartum through a series of phone questionnaires and in-person study visits. daily prenatal ambient pollutant estimates of nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and particulate matter (pm10 and pm2.5) were assigned to participant residences using inverse-distance squared spatial interpolation from ambient monitoring data. exposures were averaged for each trimester and across pregnancy. the primary outcome measure was maternal depression at 12 months postpartum, as reported on the 20-item center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale. we classified each participant as depressed (n = 29) or not depressed (n = 151) based on the suggested cutoff of 16 or above (possible scores range from 0 to 60) and fitted logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. results: we found over a two-fold increased odds of depression at 12 months postpartum associated with second trimester no2 exposure (or = 2.63, 95% ci: 1.41–4.89) and pregnancy average no2 (or = 2.04, 95% ci: 1.13–3.69). higher second trimester pm2.5 exposure also was associated with increased depression at 12 months postpartum (or = 1.56, 95% ci: 1.01–2.42). the effect for second trimester pm10 was similar and was borderline significant (or = 1.58, 95% ci: 0.97–2.56). conclusions: in a low-income cohort consisting of primarily hispanic/latina women in urban los angeles, we found that prenatal ambient air pollution, especially mid-pregnancy no2 and pm2.5, increased the risk of depression at 12 months after childbirth. these results underscore the need to better understand the contribution of modifiable

however, the impacts of these operations on neighborhood air quality are not well characterized. in this research, we leveraged ambient air monitoring adjacent to an oil and gas production site in los angeles, california during active and idle periods. this study analyzed continuous methane (ch4) and non-methane hydrocarbon (nmhc) measurements, together with triggered grab samples and 24 hour integrated canister samples collected by the south coast air quality management district. ambient air pollutant levels and trends were evaluated during active and idle well operations to assess changes in neighborhood air quality after the suspension of oil and gas production. we find that mean concentrations of methane, nmhc, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene, n-hexane, n-pentane, ethane, and propane decreased following the stop in production activities. using a source apportionment approach, we observed that the ""natural gas""drilling source contributed 23.7% to the total vocs measured during the active phase, and only 0.6% to the total measured vocs in the idle phase. near urban oil and gas production sites, residents may face poorer air quality due to the oil and gas activities which may pose adverse health and environmental risks among proximate communities.  © the royal society of chemistry.  air pollutants;

95% ci: 1.08–2.37) and kriged no2 and breast cancer mortality (hr = 1.45; 95% ci 1.02–2.07). gaseous and pm pollutants were positively associated with breast cancer mortality across racial/ethnic group. conclusion: in this study, air pollutants have a harmful impact on breast cancer survival. additional studies should evaluate potential confounding by socioeconomic factors. these data support maintaining clean air laws to improve survival for women with breast cancer. © 2022 the author(s)  air pollutants;

diameter less than or equal to 100 nm) may reach the brain via systemic circulation or the olfactory tract and have been implicated in the risk of brain tumors. the effects of airport-related ufp on the risk of brain tumors are not known. here we determined the association between airport-related ufp and risk of incident malignant brain cancer (n = 155) and meningioma (n = 420) diagnosed during 16.4 years of follow-up among 75,936 men and women residing in los angeles county from the multiethnic cohort study. ufp exposure from aircrafts was estimated for participants who lived within a 53 km × 43 km grid area around the los angeles international airport (lax) from date of cohort entry (1993-1996) through december 31, 2013. cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of time-varying, airport-related ufp exposure on risk of malignant brain cancer and meningioma, adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, education, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. malignant brain cancer risk in all subjects combined increased 12% [95% confidence interval (ci), 0.98-1.27] per interquartile range (iqr) of airport-related ufp exposure (~6,700 particles/cm3) for subjects with any address in the grid area surrounding the lax airport. in race/ ethnicity-stratified analyses, african americans, the subgroup who had the highest exposure, showed a hr of 1.32 (95% ci, 1.07-1.64) for malignant brain cancer per iqr in ufp exposure. ufp exposure was not related to risk of meningioma overall or by race/ethnicity. these results support the hypothesis that airport-related ufp exposure may be a risk factor for malignant brain cancers. © 2021 american association for cancer research  african americans;

the poa/co ratios decreased from about 6.5 to 5 μg/m3/ppm from 2015 to 2019, which is consistent with the trend of tailpipe emission contributions to total oc concentrations in our monitoring site. ec was also strongly correlated with no2 (r2 > 0.73) and co (r2 > 0.70) because they are emitted from the same combustion sources (e.g., vehicular emissions in central los angeles). our results show persistent and significant correlations between the concentrations of criteria gaseous pollutants and carbonaceous pm2.5 species (i.e., poa, soa, and ec) in different years, offering a straightforward approach to estimate the 24-h average concentration of these pm species in central los angeles. © 2021 elsevier ltd carbonaceous pm species;

116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

95% ci -16.7, -0.8). exposure to pm2.5 during gestational weeks 1–23 was also significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged1-23 = -0.6 mm; 95% ci -1.1, -0.2). additionally, prenatal exposure to pm10 (per iqr increase of 13 μg / m 3) between weeks 6–15 of pregnancy was significantly associated with smaller fetal abdominal circumference (βaveraged6-15 = -0.4 mm; 95% ci -0.8, -0.1). discussion: these results suggest that exposure to particulate matter in early to mid-pregnancy, but not preconception or late pregnancy, may have critical implications on fetal growth. © 2022, the author(s). air pollution;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

chemical analysis;quantifying ambient concentrations of primary and secondary organic aerosol in central los angeles using an integrated approach coupling source apportionment with regression analysis the main objective of this study was to explore the correlations between carbonaceous pm2.5 species (i.e., primary and secondary organic aerosols (poas and soas) and elemental carbon (ec)) with various criteria gaseous pollutants over the 2015–2019 period in order to devise a simple way of estimating the 24-hr concentration of these pm species in central los angeles. the positive matrix factorization (pmf) model was used to determine the contribution of various sources to organic carbon (oc) and its volatility fractions (oc1-oc3) in the atmosphere in years of 2015, 2017, and 2019. a 5-factor solution that includes vehicular exhaust emissions (traced by ec and oc1), non-tailpipe emissions (characterized by ti, cu, and zn), soas (identified by sulfate and ozone), biomass burning (associated with high loadings of k+/k), and local industrial activities (traced by cr) was identified as the most physically interpretable solution for each of the investigated years. the soa concentrations determined using the pmf model output and the poa concentrations, calculated by subtracting the soa concentrations from the total oc mass, were employed in our regression analysis with criteria gaseous pollutants, the concentrations of which are routinely reported by the air quality agencies. the result of the regression analysis revealed high correlation between the concentrations of soa and ozone (r2 > 0.74) in different years, probably because they are originated from synchronized photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. the soa/o3 ratios were between ∼47-56 μg/m3/ppm in the time period of 2015–2019. a strong correlation between poa and co was also observed (r2 > 0.70); the poa/co ratios decreased from about 6.5 to 5 μg/m3/ppm from 2015 to 2019, which is consistent with the trend of tailpipe emission contributions to total oc concentrations in our monitoring site. ec was also strongly correlated with no2 (r2 > 0.73) and co (r2 > 0.70) because they are emitted from the same combustion sources (e.g., vehicular emissions in central los angeles). our results show persistent and significant correlations between the concentrations of criteria gaseous pollutants and carbonaceous pm2.5 species (i.e., poa, soa, and ec) in different years, offering a straightforward approach to estimate the 24-h average concentration of these pm species in central los angeles. © 2021 elsevier ltd carbonaceous pm species;

(2) pm2.5 dominated by biomass burning in milan, italy; (3) pm2.5 formed by secondary photochemical reactions thus dominated by secondary aerosols in athens, greece; (4) pm10 emitted by refinery and dust resuspension in riyadh, saudi arabia (sa); (5) pm10 generated by dust storms in riyadh, sa, and (6) pm2.5 produced mainly by industrial and traffic emissions in beirut, lebanon. the pm samples were chemically analyzed and their oxidative potential were quantified by employing the dithiothreitol (dtt) assay. our results revealed that the milan samples were rich in water soluble organic carbon (wsoc) and pahs, even exceeding the levels measured on los angeles (la) freeways. the pm in athens was characterized by high concentrations of inorganic ions, specifically sulfate which was the highest of all pm samples. the ambient pm in la was impacted by the traffic-emitted primary organic and elemental carbon. furthermore, the contribution of metals and elements per mass of pm in riyadh and beirut samples were more pronounced relative to other sampling areas. the highest intrinsic pm redox activity was observed for pm with the highest wsoc fraction, including milan (biomass burning) and athens (secondary organic aerosols, soa). pm in areas characterized by high metal emissions including dust events, refinery and industry, such as riyadh and beirut, had the lowest oxidative potential as assessed by the dtt assay. the results of this study illustrate the impact of major emission sources in urban areas on the redox activity and oxidative potential of ambient pm, providing useful information for developing efficient air pollution control and mitigation policies in polluted areas around the globe. © 2022 rsc.

Tugboats","measurements to determine the mixing state of black carbon emitted from the 2017-2018 california wildfires and urban los angeles the effects of atmospheric black carbon (bc) on climate and public health have been well established, but large uncertainties remain regarding the extent of the impacts of bc at different temporal and spatial scales. these uncertainties are largely due to the heterogeneous nature of bc in terms of its spatiotemporal distribution, mixing state, and coating composition. here, we seek to further understand the size and mixing state of bc emitted from various sources and aged over different timescales using field measurements in the los angeles region. we measured refractory black carbon (rbc) with a single-particle soot photometer (sp2) on catalina island, california (∼ 70 km southwest of downtown los angeles) during three different time periods. during the first campaign (september 2017), westerly winds were dominant and measured air masses were representative of wellaged background over the pacific ocean. in the second and third campaigns (december 2017 and november 2018, respectively), atypical santa ana wind conditions allowed us to measure biomass burning rbc (bcbb) from air masses dominated by large biomass burning events in california and fossil fuel rbc (bcff) from the los angeles basin. we observed that the emissions source type heavily influenced both the size distribution of the rbc cores and the rbc mixing state. bcbb had thicker coatings and larger core diameters than bbff. we observed a mean coating thickness (ctbc) of ∼ 40 70 nm and a count mean diameter (cmd) of ∼ 120 nm for bcbb. for bcff, we observed a ctbc of ∼ 5 15 nm and a cmd of ∼ 100 nm. our observations also provided evidence that aging led to an increased ctbc for both bcbb and bcff. aging timescales < ∼ 1 d were insufficient to thickly coat freshly emitted bcff. however, ctbc for aged bcff within aged background plumes was ∼ 35 nm thicker than ctbc for fresh bcff. likewise, we found that ctbc for aged bcbb was ∼ 18 nm thicker than ctbc for fresh bcbb. the results presented in this study highlight the wide variability in the bc mixing state and provide additional evidence that the emissions source type and aging influence rbc microphysical properties.  © 2020 author(s).  california;

∼30 km east of downtown los angeles. we found that an average pavement albedo increase of 0.18 (from 0.08 to 0.26) corresponded to maximum neighborhood averaged t surface and t air reductions of 5 °c and 0.2 °c, respectively. maximum t surface reductions were observed in the afternoon, while minimum reductions of 0.9 °c were observed in the morning. t air reductions were detected at 12:00 local standard time (lst), and from 20:00 lst to 22:59 lst, suggesting that cool pavement decreases t air during the daytime as well as in the evening. an average albedo reduction of 30% corresponded to a ∼1 °c reduction in the t surface cooling efficacy. although we present here the first measured t air reductions due to cool pavement, we emphasize that the tradeoffs between t air reductions and reflected shortwave radiation increases are still unclear and warrant further investigation in order to holistically assess the efficacy of cool pavements, especially with regards to pedestrian thermal comfort.  © 2022 the author(s). published by iop publishing ltd. climate change;

transportation planning","impacts of distinct travel behaviors on potential air pollution exposure measurement error prior studies typically estimate air pollution exposure at places of residence only; however, people are likely to conduct daily activities at out-of-home locations. overlooking human mobility in exposure estimation can introduce measurement error in health analyses and may lead to ineffective public policies. we simulated travel mobility patterns for 100,784 residents of los angeles county and their exposure to outdoor pm2.5 on a typical weekday. we used k-means clustering via principal components analysis (pca) to subdivide subjects into seven travel behavior clusters and compared their mobility-based dynamic pm2.5 exposures to their residence-based static exposure using our previously developed spatiotemporal model. travel behavior correlated with exposure to outdoor pm2.5 and with the degree of pm2.5 exposure measurement error. workers with long commuting distance (and highest income) had the lowest dynamic pm2.5 exposure (8.1 μg/m3), while workers who relied on public transit (and were generally lower income) had the highest exposure (8.8 μg/m3). in general, lower income individuals lived in more polluted neighborhoods and took longer duration (but shorter distance) commutes to work locations with similarly elevated pm2.5 concentrations, while higher income individuals took longer distance commutes (similar duration) from less polluted residential to more polluted occupational neighborhoods. “worker” and frequent traveler clusters with highest mobility had the highest exposure measurement error, and the non-worker “stay-at-home” cluster and student clusters had the lowest. the extent of exposure measurement error generally correlated with pollution levels at the residential location and distance (less so duration) of travel away from the residential neighborhood. our results contribute to the literature on effects of travel behavior on exposure measurement error. the generated activity clusters combined with sociodemographic information provide additional information for researchers to understand which groups of people may be more challenging to model or predict their exposures accurately. © 2023 elsevier ltd clustering;

spatial cv r2 = 0.88, spatial rmse = 4.33 μg/m3; temporal cv r2 = 0.90, temporal rmse = 3.85 μg/m3). our model was able to predict spatial and diurnal patterns in pm2.5 on typical weekdays and weekends, as well as non-typical days, such as holidays and wildfire days. the model allows for far more precise estimates of pm2.5 than existing methods based on few sensors. taking advantage of low-cost pm2.5 sensors, our hourly random forest model predictions can be combined with time-activity diaries in future studies, enabling geographically and temporally fine exposure estimation for specific population groups in studies of acute air pollution health effects and studies of environmental justice issues. © 2020 air pollution;

65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

however, most studies are limited in investigating longitudinal changes in these acute effects. this study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. methods: we conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8–16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. we deployed the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit developed in the los angeles prisms center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (gps), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. hourly ambient (pm2.5, nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (nox) and pm2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. we used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (pef), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. results: participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4–16.8) with mean (sd) morning %predicted fev1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and pef of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use. participants reported chest tightness, wheeze, trouble breathing, and cough symptoms on 36.4%, 17.5%, 32.3%, and 42.9%, respectively (n = 217 person-days). one sd increase in previous day o3 exposure was associated with reduced morning (beta [95% ci]: −4.11 [−6.86, −1.36]), evening (−2.65 [−5.19, −0.10]) and daily average %predicted fev1 (−3.45 [−6.42, −0.47]). daily (lag 0) exposure to traffic-related pm2.5 exposure was associated with reduced morning %predicted pef (−3.97 [−7.69, −0.26]) and greater odds of “feeling scared of trouble breathing” symptom (odds ratio [95% ci]: 1.83 [1.03, 3.24]). exposure to ambient o3, nox, and no was significantly associated with increased rescue inhaler use (rate ratio [95% ci]: o3 1.52 [1.02, 2.27], nox 1.61 [1.23, 2.11], no 1.80 [1.37, 2.35]). conclusions: we found significant associations of air pollution exposure with lung function, rescue inhaler use, and “feeling scared of trouble breathing.” our study demonstrates the potential of informatics and wearable sensor technologies at collecting highly resolved, contextual, and personal exposure data for understanding acute pediatric asthma triggers. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. gps;

116 female children [50.7%] and 113 male children [49.3%]) who had mufsgmeasured were included in the study. median (iqr) mufsgwas 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/l, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a total problems t score in the borderline clinical or clinical range. a 1-iqr (0.68 mg/l) increase in mufsgwas associated with nearly double the odds of the total problems t score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.17-2.86; p =.008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in t score for the internalizing problems composite (b = 2.29; 95% ci, 0.47-4.11; p =.01) and a 2.14-point increase in t score for the total problems composite (b = 2.14; 95% ci, 0.29-3.98; p =.02). conclusions and relevance: in this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in los angeles, california, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. these findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.. © 2024 american medical association. all rights reserved.  adult;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; pregnancy;sources of personal pm2.5 exposure during pregnancy in the madres cohort background: personal exposure to fine particulate matter (pm2.5) is impacted by different sources each with different chemical composition. determining these sources is important for reducing personal exposure and its health risks especially during pregnancy. objective: identify main sources and their contributions to the personal pm2.5 exposure in 213 women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in los angeles, ca. methods: we measured 48-hr integrated personal pm2.5 exposure and analyzed filters for pm2.5 mass, elemental composition, and optical carbon fractions. we used the epa positive matrix factorization (pmf) model to resolve and quantify the major sources of personal pm2.5 exposure. we then investigated bivariate relationships between sources, time-activity patterns, and environmental exposures in activity spaces and residential neighborhoods to further understand sources. results: mean personal pm2.5 mass concentration was 22.3 (sd = 16.6) μg/m3. twenty-five species and pm2.5 mass were used in pmf with a final r2 of 0.48. we identified six sources (with major species in profiles and % contribution to pm2.5 mass) as follows: secondhand smoking (shs) (brown carbon, environmental tobacco smoke; 65.3%), fuel oil (nickel, vanadium; 11.7%), crustal (aluminum, calcium, silicon; 11.5%), fresh sea salt (sodium, chlorine; 4.7%), aged sea salt (sodium, magnesium, sulfur; 4.3%), and traffic (black carbon, zinc; 2.6%). shs was significantly greater in apartments compared to houses. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt increased with temperature and outdoor ozone, while fresh sea salt was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. traffic was positively correlated with ambient no2 and traffic-related nox at residence. overall, 76.8% of personal pm2.5 mass came from indoor or personal compared to outdoor sources. impact: we conducted source apportionment of personal pm2.5 samples in pregnancy in los angeles, ca. among identified sources, secondhand smoking contributed the most to the personal exposure. in addition, traffic, crustal, fuel oil, fresh and aged sea salt sources were also identified as main sources. traffic sources contained markers of combustion and non-exhaust wear emissions. crustal source was correlated with more occupants in the household. aged sea salt source increased with temperature and outdoor ozone and fresh sea salt source was highest on days with westerly winds from the pacific ocean. © the author(s) 2024. personal exposure;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

however, their impacts on prenatal depression remain unknown. we evaluated associations of third trimester ope metabolites on maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. methods: this study included 422 participants in the maternal and developmental risks from environmental and social stressors (madres) cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of primarily low-income and hispanic participants residing in los angeles, california. we measured concentrations of nine opes in third trimester spot urine samples (mean gestational age = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). using the center for epidemiologic studies-depression (ces-d) scale, we classified participants as having probable depression during pregnancy (n = 137) or not (n = 285) if one or more ces-d scores administered at each trimester met the suggested cutoff score for clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥16). we estimated associations of prenatal ope metabolite concentrations in tertiles and risk of prenatal depression using modified log-poisson regression. we examined associations of the ope mixture on depression during pregnancy using bayesian kernel machine regression (bkmr). results: participants with the highest tertiles of dphp and bdcipp exposure had a 67% (95% ci: 22%, 128%) and 47% (95% ci: 4%, 108%) increased risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, respectively. no associations between other ope metabolites and maternal depression symptoms were observed. in mixture analyses, we observed a positive and linear association between higher exposure to the ope metabolite mixture and odds of prenatal maternal depression, primarily driven by dphp. conclusions: our findings provide new evidence of associations between frequently detected ope metabolites on maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy. results could inform future intervention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal maternal depression. © 2024 elsevier inc. maternal depression;

however, most studies are limited in investigating longitudinal changes in these acute effects. this study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. methods: we conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8–16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. we deployed the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit developed in the los angeles prisms center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (gps), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. hourly ambient (pm2.5, nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (nox) and pm2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. we used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (pef), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. results: participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4–16.8) with mean (sd) morning %predicted fev1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and pef of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use. participants reported chest tightness, wheeze, trouble breathing, and cough symptoms on 36.4%, 17.5%, 32.3%, and 42.9%, respectively (n = 217 person-days). one sd increase in previous day o3 exposure was associated with reduced morning (beta [95% ci]: −4.11 [−6.86, −1.36]), evening (−2.65 [−5.19, −0.10]) and daily average %predicted fev1 (−3.45 [−6.42, −0.47]). daily (lag 0) exposure to traffic-related pm2.5 exposure was associated with reduced morning %predicted pef (−3.97 [−7.69, −0.26]) and greater odds of “feeling scared of trouble breathing” symptom (odds ratio [95% ci]: 1.83 [1.03, 3.24]). exposure to ambient o3, nox, and no was significantly associated with increased rescue inhaler use (rate ratio [95% ci]: o3 1.52 [1.02, 2.27], nox 1.61 [1.23, 2.11], no 1.80 [1.37, 2.35]). conclusions: we found significant associations of air pollution exposure with lung function, rescue inhaler use, and “feeling scared of trouble breathing.” our study demonstrates the potential of informatics and wearable sensor technologies at collecting highly resolved, contextual, and personal exposure data for understanding acute pediatric asthma triggers. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. gps;

32%), overlapping sensitive windows were observed for all pollutants from 8 weeks before to 10 weeks postconception with increased risk of gh (pm2.5, 16% [95% ci, 3%-31%]; pm10, 39% [95% ci, 13%-72%]; nitrogen dioxide, 65% [95% ci, 17%-134%]; and ozone, 45% [95% ci, 9%-93%]), while the associations were close to null among those without prenatal depression. air pollutants were not associated with preeclampsia in any analyses. conclusions: we identified periconception through early pregnancy as a susceptible window of air pollution exposure with an increased risk of gh. prenatal depression increases vulnerability to air pollution exposure and gh. © 2024 american heart association, inc. air pollution;

pm2.5), nitrogen dioxide (no2), and ozone (o3) in each week from 12 weeks before to 24 weeks after conception, adjusting for potential confounders, with distributed lag models to identify susceptible exposure windows. we examined effect modification by prenatal depression, median-split pre-pregnancy bmi (ppbmi) and age. findings: sixty (9.7%) participants were diagnosed with gdm among 617 participants (mean age: 28.2 years, sd: 5.9; 78.6% hispanic, 11.8% non-hispanic black). gdm risk increased with exposure to pm2.5, pm10, and no2 in a periconceptional window ranging from 5 weeks before to 5 weeks after conception: interquartile-range increases in pm2.5, pm10, and no2 during this window were associated with increased gdm risk by 5.7% (95% ci: 4.6–6.8), 8.9% (8.1–9.6), and 15.0% (13.9–16.2), respectively. these sensitive windows generally widened, with greater effects, among those with prenatal depression, with age ≥28 years, or with ppbmi ≥27.5 kg/m2, than their counterparts. interpretation: preconception and early-pregnancy are susceptible windows of air pollutants exposure that increased gdm risk. prenatal depression, higher age, or higher ppbmi may increase one's vulnerability to air pollution-associated gdm risk. funding: national institutes of health, environmental protection agency. © 2023 the author(s) air pollution;

mean age: 11.1 ± 1.7 years; pre-pubertal/pubertal/post-pubertal: 85/101/17; bmi z-score: 2.1 ± 0.4). cumulative concentrations of no2, o3 and pm2.5 were spatially interpolated at the residential addresses based on measurements from community monitors up to 12 months prior to testing. single and multi-pollutant linear effects models were used to test the cumulative monthly lag effects of no2, o3, and pm2.5 on morning serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, sex, seasonality, social position, pubertal status, and body fat percent by dexa. results: single and multi-pollutant models showed that higher o3 exposure (derived from maximum 8-h exposure windows) in the prior 1–7 months was associated with higher serum morning cortisol (p < 0.05) and longer term pm2.5 exposure (4–10 months) was associated with lower serum morning cortisol levels (p < 0.05). stratification by pubertal status showed associations in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal and post-pubertal children. single, but not multi-pollutant, models showed that higher no2 over the 4–10 month exposure period associated with lower morning serum cortisol (p < 0.05). conclusions: chronic ambient no2, o3 and pm2.5 differentially associate with hpa-axis dysfunction, a mechanism that may serve as an explanatory pathway in the relationship between ambient air pollution and metabolic health of youth living in polluted urban environments. further research that uncovers how ambient air pollutants may differentially contribute to hpa-axis dysfunction are warranted. © 2021, the author(s). ambient air pollution;

urbanization","","towards a hygroscopic growth calibration for low-cost pm2.5 sensors low-cost particulate matter (pm) sensors continue to grow in popularity, but issues such as aerosol-size-dependent sensitivity drive the need for effective calibration schemes. here we devise a time-evolving calibration method for the plantower pms5003 pm2.5 mass concentration measurements. we use 2 years of measurements from the berkeley environmental air-quality and co2 network sensors deployed in san francisco and los angeles in our analysis. the calibration uses a hygroscopic growth correction factor derived from κ-köhler theory, where the calibration parameters are determined empirically using us environmental protection agency air quality system (epa aqs) reference data at co-location sites during the period from 2021-2022. the parameters are found to vary cyclically through the seasons, and the seasonal cycles match changes in sulfate and elemental carbon pm composition fractions throughout the year. in both regions, the seasonal rh dependence calibration performs better than the uncalibrated data and data calibrated with the epa's national plantower calibration algorithm. in the san francisco bay area, the seasonal rh dependence calibration reduces the root mean square error (rmse) by ĝ1/440% from the uncalibrated data and maintains a mean bias much smaller than the epa national calibration scheme (-0.90 vs -2.73μgm-3). we also find that calibration parameters forecasted beyond those fit with the epa reference data continue to outperform the uncalibrated data and epa calibration data, enabling real-time application of the calibration scheme even in the absence of reference data. while the correction greatly improves the data accuracy, non-gaussian distribution of the residuals suggests that other processes besides hygroscopic growth can be parameterized for future improvement of this calibration. © 2024 copernicus publications. all rights reserved.  berkeley;

1900 ce (rates obtained were 9 and 12 mg cm-2 yr-1). the δ13corg profiles show a relatively constant value where laminations are present, suggesting that the change in sediment accumulation rate is not accompanied by a change in organic carbon sources to the basin. the increase in sedimentation rate towards the recent occurs at about the time previous studies predicted an increase in siltation and the demise of a shelly shelf benthic fauna on the smb shelf. x-radiographs show finely laminated sediments in the deepest part of the basin only, with centimeter-scale layering of sediments or no layering whatsoever in shallower parts of the smb basin. the absence of finely laminated sediments in cores muc 10 (893 m) and muc 3 (777 m) suggests that the rate at which anoxia is spreading has not increased appreciably since cores were last analyzed in the 1980s. based on core top data collected during the past half century, sedimentary dynamics within smb have changed minimally during the last 40 years. specifically, mass accumulation rates, laminated sediment fabric, extent of bioturbation and % corg have not changed. the only parameter that appeared to have changed in the last 450 years was the mar, with an apparent > 50 % increase occurring between &tild; 1850 ce and the early 1900s. the post-1900 ce constancy of sedimentation through a period of massive urbanization in los angeles is surprising. © author(s) 2020.  california; los angeles [california];

however, most studies are limited in investigating longitudinal changes in these acute effects. this study aims to investigate the effects of daily air pollution exposure on acute pediatric asthma exacerbation risk using a repeated-measures design. methods: we conducted a panel study of 40 children aged 8–16 years with moderate-to-severe asthma. we deployed the biomedical reai-time health evaluation (breathe) kit developed in the los angeles prisms center to continuously monitor personal exposure to particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (pm2.5), relative humidity and temperature, geolocation (gps), and asthma outcomes including lung function, medication use, and symptoms for 14 days. hourly ambient (pm2.5, nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3)) and traffic-related (nitrogen oxides (nox) and pm2.5) air pollution exposures were modeled based on location. we used mixed-effects models to examine the association of same day and lagged (up to 2 days) exposures with daily changes in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and % predicted peak expiratory flow (pef), count of rescue inhaler puffs, and symptoms. results: participants were on average 12.0 years old (range: 8.4–16.8) with mean (sd) morning %predicted fev1 of 67.9% (17.3%) and pef of 69.1% (18.4%) and 1.4 (3.5) puffs per day of rescue inhaler use. participants reported chest tightness, wheeze, trouble breathing, and cough symptoms on 36.4%, 17.5%, 32.3%, and 42.9%, respectively (n = 217 person-days). one sd increase in previous day o3 exposure was associated with reduced morning (beta [95% ci]: −4.11 [−6.86, −1.36]), evening (−2.65 [−5.19, −0.10]) and daily average %predicted fev1 (−3.45 [−6.42, −0.47]). daily (lag 0) exposure to traffic-related pm2.5 exposure was associated with reduced morning %predicted pef (−3.97 [−7.69, −0.26]) and greater odds of “feeling scared of trouble breathing” symptom (odds ratio [95% ci]: 1.83 [1.03, 3.24]). exposure to ambient o3, nox, and no was significantly associated with increased rescue inhaler use (rate ratio [95% ci]: o3 1.52 [1.02, 2.27], nox 1.61 [1.23, 2.11], no 1.80 [1.37, 2.35]). conclusions: we found significant associations of air pollution exposure with lung function, rescue inhaler use, and “feeling scared of trouble breathing.” our study demonstrates the potential of informatics and wearable sensor technologies at collecting highly resolved, contextual, and personal exposure data for understanding acute pediatric asthma triggers. © 2022 by the authors. licensee mdpi, basel, switzerland. gps;

mean age: 11.1 ± 1.7 years; pre-pubertal/pubertal/post-pubertal: 85/101/17; bmi z-score: 2.1 ± 0.4). cumulative concentrations of no2, o3 and pm2.5 were spatially interpolated at the residential addresses based on measurements from community monitors up to 12 months prior to testing. single and multi-pollutant linear effects models were used to test the cumulative monthly lag effects of no2, o3, and pm2.5 on morning serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, sex, seasonality, social position, pubertal status, and body fat percent by dexa. results: single and multi-pollutant models showed that higher o3 exposure (derived from maximum 8-h exposure windows) in the prior 1–7 months was associated with higher serum morning cortisol (p < 0.05) and longer term pm2.5 exposure (4–10 months) was associated with lower serum morning cortisol levels (p < 0.05). stratification by pubertal status showed associations in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal and post-pubertal children. single, but not multi-pollutant, models showed that higher no2 over the 4–10 month exposure period associated with lower morning serum cortisol (p < 0.05). conclusions: chronic ambient no2, o3 and pm2.5 differentially associate with hpa-axis dysfunction, a mechanism that may serve as an explanatory pathway in the relationship between ambient air pollution and metabolic health of youth living in polluted urban environments. further research that uncovers how ambient air pollutants may differentially contribute to hpa-axis dysfunction are warranted. © 2021, the author(s). ambient air pollution;

spatial cv r2 = 0.88, spatial rmse = 4.33 μg/m3; temporal cv r2 = 0.90, temporal rmse = 3.85 μg/m3). our model was able to predict spatial and diurnal patterns in pm2.5 on typical weekdays and weekends, as well as non-typical days, such as holidays and wildfire days. the model allows for far more precise estimates of pm2.5 than existing methods based on few sensors. taking advantage of low-cost pm2.5 sensors, our hourly random forest model predictions can be combined with time-activity diaries in future studies, enabling geographically and temporally fine exposure estimation for specific population groups in studies of acute air pollution health effects and studies of environmental justice issues. © 2020 air pollution;

13–23%) and magnetite (fe3o4; 10–24%) identified as major crystalline oxide components. an fe-bearing phyllosilicate fraction (16–23%) was fit best with a reference spectrum of a natural illite/smectite mineral, and metallic fe(0) was a relatively small (2–6%) but easily identified component. sizes, morphologies, oxidation state, and trace element compositions of fe-bearing pm from electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy (eels), and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (stxm) revealed variable and heterogeneous mixtures of fe species and phases, often associated with carbonaceous material with evidence of surface oxidation. ferrihydrite (or related fe(iii) hydroxide phases) was ubiquitous in pm samples. it forms as an oxidation or surface alteration product of crystalline fe phases, and also occurs as coatings or nanoparticles dispersed with other phases as a result of environmental dissolution and re-precipitation reactions. the prevalence of ferrihydrite (and adsorbed fe(iii)) has likely been underestimated in studies of ambient pm because it is non-crystalline, non-magnetic, more soluble than crystalline phases, and found in complex mixtures. review of potential sources of different particle types suggests that the majority of fe-bearing pm from these urban sites originates from anthropogenic activities, primarily abrasion products from vehicle braking systems and engine emissions from combustion and/or wear. these variable mixtures have a high probability for electron transfer reactions between fe, redox-active metals such as copper, and reactive carbon species such as quinones. our findings suggest the need to assess biological responses of specific fe-bearing phases both individually and in combination to unravel mechanisms of adverse health effects of particulate fe. © 2020 6): pm<sub>2.5</sub>;

mean age: 11.1 ± 1.7 years; pre-pubertal/pubertal/post-pubertal: 85/101/17; bmi z-score: 2.1 ± 0.4). cumulative concentrations of no2, o3 and pm2.5 were spatially interpolated at the residential addresses based on measurements from community monitors up to 12 months prior to testing. single and multi-pollutant linear effects models were used to test the cumulative monthly lag effects of no2, o3, and pm2.5 on morning serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, sex, seasonality, social position, pubertal status, and body fat percent by dexa. results: single and multi-pollutant models showed that higher o3 exposure (derived from maximum 8-h exposure windows) in the prior 1–7 months was associated with higher serum morning cortisol (p < 0.05) and longer term pm2.5 exposure (4–10 months) was associated with lower serum morning cortisol levels (p < 0.05). stratification by pubertal status showed associations in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal and post-pubertal children. single, but not multi-pollutant, models showed that higher no2 over the 4–10 month exposure period associated with lower morning serum cortisol (p < 0.05). conclusions: chronic ambient no2, o3 and pm2.5 differentially associate with hpa-axis dysfunction, a mechanism that may serve as an explanatory pathway in the relationship between ambient air pollution and metabolic health of youth living in polluted urban environments. further research that uncovers how ambient air pollutants may differentially contribute to hpa-axis dysfunction are warranted. © 2021, the author(s). ambient air pollution;

n = 18/group). microglia were characterized by immunohistochemical double staining of ionized calcium-binding protein-1 (iba-1) with inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) to identify proinflammatory cells, and iba-1 with arginase-1 (arg) to identify anti-inflammatory/ homeostatic cells. myelin injury was assessed by degraded myelin basic protein (dmbp). oligodendrocyte cell counts were evaluated by oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (olig2). axonal injury was assessed by axonal neurofilament marker smi-312. inos-expressing microglia were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to npm when compared to those exposed to filtered air (2.2 fold increase; p<0.05). this was accompanied by an increase in dmbp (1.4 fold increase; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density, a decrease in oligodendrocyte cell counts (1.16 fold decrease; p<0.05), and a decrease in neurofilament smi-312 (1.13 fold decrease; p<0.05) immunofluorescent density. exposure to npm results in increased inflammatory microglia, white matter injury, and axonal degradation in the corpus callosum of adult male mice. inos-expressing microglia release cytokines and reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species which may further contribute to the white matter damage observed in this model. © 2021 connor et al. this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.  aerosols;
